# n8n Docs

This repository hosts the documentation for [n8n](https://n8n.io/), an extendable workflow automation tool which enables you to connect anything to everything. The documentation is live at [docs.n8n.io](https://docs.n8n.io/).


## Previewing and building the documentation locally

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or above
* Pip
* We recommend using a virtual environment when working with Python, such as [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).
* Follow the [recommended configuration and auto-complete](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/creating-your-site/#minimal-configuration) guidance for the theme. This will help when working with the `mkdocs.yml` file.

### Steps

#### For members of the n8n GitHub organization:

1. Set up an SSH token and add it to your GitHub account. Refer to [GitHub | About SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh) for guidance.
2. Then run these commands:

	```bash
	git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:n8n-io/n8n-docs.git
	cd n8n-docs
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	pip install _submodules/insiders
	```

#### For external contributors:

Rely on the preview builds on pull requests, or use the free version of Material for MkDocs (most things are the same, some formatting may be missing)

```
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs.git
cd n8n-docs
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install mkdocs-material
```

#### To serve a local preview:

```
mkdocs serve
```
