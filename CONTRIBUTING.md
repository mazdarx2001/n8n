# Contributing

## Overview

These are a set of guidelines to contribute to this repository, helping ensure consistency and quality.

## Writing guidelines

* Ensure that anything you write is consistent with the same structure and writing conventions as the rest of the documentation.
* Keep your writing as concise as possible.
* Make sure to include commit messages in [this](https://gist.github.com/parmentf/035de27d6ed1dce0b36a) format.

## General checklist

The following is a list of common errors that you can use to check your own work locally before submitting a PR:

- [ ] Check spelling and grammar. [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) is a good tool to help.
- [ ] Check for any broken links.
- [ ] Ensure that branding is correct. For example, "GitHub", not "Github".
- [ ] Ensure that GIFs capture every step of the process at a uniform pace.

## Miscellaneous

- [ ] If there is more than one way to authenticate for a node, OAuth takes precedence and is listed first.
- [ ] If there are steps that are necessary, but out of the scope of creating a node in n8n, move them to the FAQ section. A good example of this would be the [Chargebee Trigger node](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.chargebeeTrigger/).
