# Contributing

## Overview

If you want to contribute to this repository, please follow the guidelines described below, in order to ensure consistency and quality.

## Documentation files

* **Main:** Create a directory with the name of the node at `docs/nodes/nodes-library/nodes/` containing:
  - A text file named `README.md` describing the functionality of the relevant node.
  - An image file named `workflow.png` showing a screenshot of the Start node connected to the relevant node.
* **Credentials:** Create a directory with the name of the node at `docs/nodes/credentials/` containing:
  - A text file called `README.md` describing how to obtain credentials for the relevant node.

## Writing guidelines

* Follow the structure and writing conventions of the existing documentation. Consistency is key.
  - In the node documentation `README.md`:
    - Under "Basic Operations", enter the resources and operations exactly as they are named in the nodes.
    - Under "Example Usage", ensure that the link of the relevant node remains empty.
    - Exclude any optional steps from the example usage steps for the relevant node.
    - Create a workflow at [n8n.io](https://n8n.io/workflows) and use the resulting link in "Example Usage".
    - If there is a relevant n8n [Medium](https://medium.com/n8n-io) article, include it under "Further Reading". The resulting list should be ordered alphabetically. See the [Telegram node](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/).
  - In the credentials `README.md`:
    - If there is more than one authentication method, list OAuth first.
    - If there are steps that are necessary but out of the scope of creating a node in n8n, move them to the FAQ section. See the [Chargebee Trigger node](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.chargebeeTrigger/).
* Keep your writing as concise as possible.
* Make sure to include commit messages in [this](https://gist.github.com/parmentf/035de27d6ed1dce0b36a) format.


## Screenshot guidelines

Please make sure that the screenshots match the following criteria: 

- Only the Editor UI appears in the screenshot. Anything else, like the browser frame, tabs, and so on, should be omitted.
- After zooming in once, the Editor UI is 23 boxes wide and 9 boxes tall.
- The nodes have a distance of two boxes between them.
- The nodes fit inside the boxes (as much as they can).
- The workflow is centered in the Editor canvas.
- If the workflow uses a Trigger node, the Start node doesn't appear in the Editor canvas.
- In recorded GIFs, the cursor movements in the GIF are slow and easy to follow. A good rule of thumb is that the speed should be about 75% of your regular speed.
