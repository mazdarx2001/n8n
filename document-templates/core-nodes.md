# How to use this template

1. Make a new branch. If working on an internal ticket, include it at the start of the name. For example, DOC-123-feature-summary.
2. Create a new file, or find the file you want to edit, in integrations/builtin/core-nodes/. If creating a new file, pay attention to the naming conventions: it should match the node name in the codex file. For example, in the Item Lists node, the codex file (https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/ItemLists/ItemLists.node.json) reads: `"node": "n8n-nodes-base.itemList"`. So the app node file name is n8n-nodes-base.itemList.
3. Copy the template into the file (don't copy this comment).
4. Placeholder text is in _italic_ or between <>. Make sure to replace it! 
5. Before publishing, delete any comments.
