# How to use this template

1. Make a new branch. If working on an internal ticket, include it at the start of the name. For example, DOC-123-feature-summary.
2. Create a new file, or find the file you want to edit, in integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/. If creating a new file, pay attention to the naming conventions: it should match the node name in the codex file. For example, in the Active Campaign trigger node, the codex file (https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/ActiveCampaign/ActiveCampaignTrigger.node.json) reads: `"node": "n8n-nodes-base.activeCampaignTrigger"`. So the app node file name is n8n-nodes-base.activeCampaignTrigger.
3. Copy the template into the file (don't copy this comment).
4. Placeholder text is in _italic_ or between <>. Make sure to replace it! 
5. Before publishing, delete any comments.

## Common issues

<!-- 
If the node is small enough for a single page, add a subheading here for each error, quirk, pain point, or other complex topic that might trip people up. Refer to the common_issues.md template for suggested wording.

If the node is large enough to warrant subpages, create a separate Common issues page using the common-issues.md template and link to it here using this text:

For common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to [Common issues](/integrations/builtin/_relativepath_).
