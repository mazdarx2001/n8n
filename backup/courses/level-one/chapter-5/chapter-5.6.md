# 6. Notifying the Team

In this step of the workflow you will learn how to send messages to a Discord channel using the *Discord* node.

Now that you have a calculated summary of the booked orders you need to notify Nathan‚Äôs team in their Discord channel. Doc¬≤ has a **Discord node** that allows you to send messages. We'll be sending the messages to the [WF¬≤ server](https://discord.gg/G98WXzsjky) on Discord.

!!! note " Communication nodes"
    You can replace the *Discord* node with another communication app. For example, Doc¬≤ also has nodes for [*Slack*](/workflow/integrations/nodes/workflow-nodes-base.slack/) and [*Mattermost*](/workflow/integrations/nodes/workflow-nodes-base.mattermost/).


In your workflow, add a *Discord* node connected to the *Function* node. In the *Discord* node window, configure the parameters:

- *Webhook URL:* Enter the URL that you received in the email from Doc¬≤ when you signed up for this course.
- *Text (Expression):* `This week we have {{$json["totalBooked"]}} booked orders with a total value of {{$json["bookedSum"]}}. My Unique ID: {{$node["HTTP Request"].parameter["headerParametersUi"]["parameter"][0]["value"]}}`

Now execute the *Discord* node and if all works well, you should get a message in Discord:

## What's next?

**Nathan üôã**: Incredible, you've saved me so many hours of tedious work already! Now I can simply execute this workflow when I need it. I just need to remember to run it every Monday morning at 9 am...

**You üë©‚Äçüîß**: Don't worry about that, you can actually schedule the workflow to run on a specific day, time, or interval. I'll set this up in the next step.
