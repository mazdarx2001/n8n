# Take the Quiz and Get Your Certificate

Congratulations – you finished the Doc² Course Level I! You were able to help Nathan build a business use case workflow, saving him hours of tedious work and making him more productive. You’ve come a long way throughout this course and learned a lot about workflow automation.

## Certification quiz

You're almost there! The last step before earning your certificate - after [signing-up](https://WF²-community.typeform.com/to/PDEMrevI) and completing the [course milestones](/courses/level-one/#do-i-get-a-certificate) - is passing the quiz.

The quiz consists of two parts: theory and practice. Remember:

- You need to have at least 80% correct answers in each part.
- There is no time limit.
- You can take the quiz as many times as you want.
