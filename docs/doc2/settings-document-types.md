You will now see all settings you can make for this document type. For example you can configure the fields you want to extract from your documents:

**Recognition Settings**

OCR:

Here you can set the sensitivity of the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) function for all fields at once. This value determines the sensitivity with which a field is marked in red if it could not be extracted with 100% certainty (OCR related!).

MATCH SCORE:

Here you can set the sensitivity of the MATCH SCORE function for all fields at once. This value determines from when a field is marked in red if DOC² has not extracted the field with 100% probability. In this case the field needs to be validated manually.

The button "RESTORE DEFAULTS" will set back both values to "50".

**SPLIT**

You can define how imported documents shall be split. Either by page or by invoice number (if you import PDF files with more than one invoice/several invoices).

**PROFILE**

Here you can define the profile that shall be used. For example Peppol or Zugferd. If you do not explicitly use one of the two, please select "Default".

Below you will find all the fields available for this type of document. You can set the following values per field individually:  

REQUIRED: Here you can define if the field must contain a value to continue.  

READ ONLY: Here you can define if a field can only be displayed but not edited.  

HIDDEN: Here you can define whether a field should be hidden or displayed in the extraction view.  

FORCE VALIDATION: Here you can define whether a field must always be validated manually, even if it has been read 100% by DOC².  

OCR and MATCH SCORE: Setting as described above, per field.  

FORMULA: Creation of a formula per field.
