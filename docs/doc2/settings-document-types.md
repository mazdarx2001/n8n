For every overpoint you can also **CREATE FIELDS** like freight, postage or any field with an amount you want to extract from your invoices.

For each field you can check the boxes if they are:

- REQUIRED: Here you can define if the field must contain a value to continue.

- READ ONLY: Here you can define if a field can only be displayed but not edited.

- HIDDEN: Here you can define whether a field should be hidden or displayed in extraction view.

- FORCE VALIDATION: Here you can define whether a field must always be validated manually, even if it has been confidently read (100%) by DOC².

- OCR and MATCH SCORE: Setting as described below, per field.

- FORMULA: Creation of a formula per field.

If you have completed all your settings, and you wish to save them, please confirm this with the `SAVE SETTINGS` button. If this is not done, the settings will not be applied.

### RECOGNITION SETTINGS

![](/_images/doc2/DOC2_field settings_recognition settings.png)

**OCR:**

Here you can set the sensitivity of the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) function for all fields. This value determines the sensitivity with which a field is marked in red if it could not be extracted with 100% certainty (OCR related!).

**MATCH SCORE:**

Here you can set the sensitivity of the MATCH SCORE function for all fields. This value determines, when a field is marked in red, if DOC² has not extracted the field with 100% confidence. In this case the field needs to be validated manually.

The button `RESTORE DEFAULTS` will reset both values back to "50".
