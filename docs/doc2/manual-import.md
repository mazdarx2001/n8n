Documents can be uploaded to DOC² via file browser or drag and drop. Furthermore, it is possible to upload multiple documents at once.

- Click on the button "Upload Documents" to upload documents via file browser. Select the files to be uploaded in your file browser and confirm your selection. The files will then be uploaded to DOC²:

</div>

As soon as the files have been uploaded, they have the initial status "Running". During this time the upload is processed. Editing the file is not possible in this status. Depending on the size and complexity of the file, processing may take a while:

As soon as the file has been processed, it receives the status "Ready for validation". As soon as the document is in this status, validation can be started:
