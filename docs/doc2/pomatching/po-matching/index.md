There are three ways you can match your Purchase Order

1. with the corresponding [invoice](/doc2/pomatching/po-matching-invoices/)
2. with the corresponding [delivery note](/doc2/pomatching/po-matching-delivery-notes/) and  [order confirmation](/doc2/pomatching/po-matching-order-confirmation/)<br> 
All three components must match within agreed-upon tolerance levels. It is then entered into the AP system.
3. with all the above documents, but also requires control information such as actual number of items delivered and their quality control. Once all 4 components match, the invoice is entered into the AP database.

#### Corresponding settings must be made in DOC² under Settings - Modules - Purchase Order

On documents, the Purchase Order is listed either in the headers or, for some, in the table rows.

During validation, the supplier's PO must be extracted correctly.

Create the table from Purchase Order with one klick. See how easy that is:
