# Table Extraction

With DOC² it is possible to extract tables from PDF-Files. That will be done via the "Line Items" functionality. It is used for extracting the tables from all types of documents (Invoices, Contracts, Forms, Medical Prescriptions etc.).

The extraction of data in tables can be achieved by following the steps described below:

1\. Login to your account with Email and Password you are given.

2\. On Dashboard, import any document

3\. Click on the document to Open

4\. Now, scroll down the extracted fields page to **Line Items** section

5\. Click on the table icon inside the textbox

You will end up in the table extraction view.

If the document contains very simple tables it will detect and extract them automatically:

In practice, tables on documents are often much more complex and have a wide variety of formatting and arrangements. For example, text may extend across several columns or there may be several lines of text in one position line. For example, in the case of long item descriptions or similar:
