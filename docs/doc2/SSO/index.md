## What is Single Sign On?
With SSO, your teams only need one set of credentials to conveniently access all their apps. Nobody has to remember different variants or repeatedly enter passwords.

#### Faster login
Make signing up easy by banning all or part of the sign-in prompts.

#### Higher productivity
Make it easier for employees to find and access apps with the central 1-click launch function.

#### Advanced security
Avoid re-entering usernames and passwords in apps to minimize security risk.

#### Greater IT efficiency
Manage user accounts in one place. Group memberships or roles can be used to automatically grant or revoke user access to apps.
