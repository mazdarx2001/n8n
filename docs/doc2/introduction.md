![](/_images/doc2/flow2-1024x286.png)

is a document management system (DMS).

  
Its purpose is to store, search and categorize files so that the context and business information of documents is preserved.

  
The content of these files can be read by OCR.

  
Documents can be previewed, labeled, signed, sent and received.

  
It provides a workflow system to automate recurring tasks, role-based access control, and a REST API to call appropriate functions programmatically

### Definition of terms

#### Metadata

Metadata is key information used for classification and easy access of the document management system to the documents. The information relates to the relevant content of the file. It can be an invoice number, the date of a document or the type of document, e.g. "incoming invoice".

#### Tags

Tags (keywords) make it easy to identify documents. You can use colors, for example, to make tagged documents easy to find in the workflow.

#### Workflow

Workflows are a collection of states, transitions (between states), actions (to be taken when a transition occurs), and Triggers (that cause a transition to occur).

#### Transitions

Transitions are used to move documents from one state to another. In this way, a document is taken from 0% completion to 30% completion to 100% completion.

Transitions always have an initial state and a target state. Transitions do not have to be linear (e.g., 10% > 20% > 30%, etc.) and can have any initial or target state. A workflow can have as many transitions as you need. This allows an unlimited number of combinations of states, transitions, and actions, and allows full customization to meet the needs of your workflow process.

#### ACL - Access Control List

An Access Control List (ACL) is a list of permissions associated with a system resource. An ACL defines which users or system processes are granted access to objects and which operations are allowed with certain objects.  
We can select elements (workflows, states, documents, indexes, file cabinets, tags) and then select the group and permissions specific to this object.

#### OCR - Optical Character Recognition

Optical Character Recognition is the electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine encoded text, whether from a scanned document or a photograph of a document.
