This guide will help you learn the basics of DOC² get you up and running with an IPS that will max out your productivity.

## **Performing Initial Setup**

First, let's cover how to access and configure your system.

DOC² does not work in Tenant. All customer use the same cluster. Our Kubernetes Cluster is hosted in Frankfurt / Germany.

[https://doc2app.cloudintegration.eu/](https://doc2app.cloudintegration.eu/)

To access the system:

1. Contact your Fellow Consulting representative or reach out to [support@fellow-consulting.de](mailto:support@fellow-consulting.de) to create a Organisation.
2. Go to the [App](https://doc2app.cloudintegration.eu/). We recommend bookmarking this URL for future reference.
3. Log in with the credentials provided in your onboarding email.

**Tip:** Can't find the onboarding email? Go to your login screen and click the **Forgot your password?** link.

### Step 2. Adding Users

After logging in, you'll need to add users to your tenant. When you add a user, they'll receive an onboarding email with a username and temporary password.

You can add users from **Settings** \> **Users**. For help, refer to [Adding Users](/doc2/doc2app/settings-users/).

## **Understanding Document Review**

After the initial setup is complete, most of your time in Semantik will be spent reviewing for example invoices.

**Sending Document to DOC²**

1. Manuel Upload
2. Email
3. API
4. or use our WatchDog for Directories

### Reviewing Extracted Results

If an document is not automatically processed, it will be stopped for manual review. This means you will need to edit or approve fields the system wasn't confident on, or couldn't find.

To review extracted results:

1. On the **Dashboard**, click **on the document** to assign the 10 oldest invoices in the system to yourself. You'll be taken to the **Review** screen.
2. Review the extracted results. Refer to Reviewing Your document for more information.
3. When you're satisfied, click **Complete Review**.
