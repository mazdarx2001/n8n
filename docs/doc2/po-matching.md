+++DOCUMENTATION IN PROGRESS+++

There are three ways you can match your Purchase Order

1. with the corresponding [invoice](/doc2/doc2app/po-matching/po-matching-invoices/)
2. with the corresponding [delivery note](/doc2/doc2app/po-matching/po-matching-delivery-notes/)
3. with the corresponding [order confirmation](/doc2/doc2app/po-matching/po-matching-order-confirmation/)

#### Corresponding settings must be made in DOC²

Settings - Modules - Purchase Order

On documents, the Purchase Order is listed either in the headers or, for some, in the table rows.

During validation, the supplier's PO must be extracted correctly.
