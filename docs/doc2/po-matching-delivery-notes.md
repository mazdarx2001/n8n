If quantity of the ordered item(s) does not match the quantity on the invoice you need to start the match with received Delivery Note.

## Upload the Delivery Note in DOC2

Here you will also find the red symbol, because the quantity on the delivery note does not match the quantity of the purchase order.

Access the matching overview by clicking on the Matching Symbol on the dashboard.

Or by choosing PO Matching in the lower right corner when you have opened the document.

The matches can now be corrected:  
  
The “x” would delete the match on the invoice.  
  
A new match from the purchase order can be added to the delivery note by dragging and dropping the appropriate data row(s).
