# Merging data streams

Merging allows you to bring multiple data streams together.

Merging data from different branches or nodes uses the [Merge](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) node. To merge data from multiple node executions in a single node or multiple nodes, use the [Code](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node.

To compare data, merge it, and output data streams depending on the comparison, use the [Compare Datasets](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.comparedatasets/) node.


## Merge data from different branches

If your workflow [splits](/flow-logic/splitting/), you combine the separate branches back into one branch.

Here's an [example workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1747-joining-different-datasets/) showing different types of merging: appending data sets, keeping only new items, and keeping only existing items. The [Merge node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) documentation contains details on each of the merge operations.

## Merge data from different nodes

You can use the Merge node to combine data from two previous nodes, even if the workflow hasn't split into branches. This can be useful if you want to generate a single dataset from the data generated by multiple nodes.

## Merge data from multiple node executions

Use the Code node to merge data from multiple node executions. This is useful in some [Looping](/flow-logic/looping/) scenarios.

/// note | Node executions and workflow executions
This section describes merging data from multiple node executions. This is when a node executes multiple times during a single workflow execution. 
///
Refer to this [example workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1814-merge-multiple-runs-into-one/){:target=_blank .external-link} using Loop Over Items and Wait to artificially create multiple executions.

## Compare, merge, and split again

The [Compare Datasets](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.comparedatasets/) node compares data streams before merging them. It outputs up to four different branches.

Refer to this [example workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1943-comparing-data-with-the-compare-datasets-node/){:target=_blank .external-link} for an example.
