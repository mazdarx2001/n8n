# Error workflows

For each workflow, you can set an error workflow in **Workflow Settings**. It runs if an execution fails. This means you can, for example, send email or Slack alerts when a workflow execution errors. 

You can use the same error workflow for multiple workflows.

## Error data

The default error data received by the Error Trigger is:

```json
[
	{
		"execution": {
			"id": "231",
			"url": "https://n8n.example.com/execution/231",
			"retryOf": "34",
			"error": {
				"message": "Example Error Message",
				"stack": "Stacktrace"
			},
			"lastNodeExecuted": "Node With Error",
			"mode": "manual"
		},
		"workflow": {
			"id": "1",
			"name": "Example Workflow"
		}
	}
]

```

All information is always present, except:

- `execution.id`: requires the execution to be saved in the database.
- `execution.url`: requires the execution to be saved in the database.
- `execution.retryOf`: only present when the execution is a retry of a failed execution.

## Cause a workflow execution failure using Stop And Error

When you create and set an error workflow, n8n runs it when an execution fails. Usually, this is due to things like errors in node settings, or the workflow running out of memory.

You can add the [Stop And Error](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stopanderror/) node to your workflow to force executions to fail under your chosen circumstances, and trigger the error workflow.
