This Process step is designed for the upload of your pdf document. When you open it up, you are asked to post and then to "try it out" in the top right corner.

After doing so, you are able to choose different parameters for the OCR transformation. These parameters define the quality of our server as they indicate various functionalities of it.

## Parameters

The parameters show the name, the description and a field for either true/false, a number to be typed in, or a three digit langauage code to be chosen.

We will now explain the various parameters:

**JPG quality** refers to the JPEG Compression Setting, which is by default set to 1.

**Optimize** refers to the general Compression Setting, which is by default set to 1.

**PDFa** allows you to choose between a pdf or a pdf format for the transformed document you will receive.

**Language** allows you to type in a three digit language code for the language your document is written in. This is important for our server to understand your document.

**Deskew** (true/false): Decide whether you want your document deskewed or not.

**Clean** (true/false): Decide whether you want your document cleaned before transformation or not.

**Final** (true/false): Decide whether you want your document cleaned after transformation or not.

**Background** (true/false): Decide whether you want background removed or not.

**Rotate** (true/false): Decide whether you want pages to be rotated.

**Force** (true/false): Decide whether you want OCR to be forced, even if it will not be perfect.

**Blank\_pages** (true/false): Decide whether you want blank pages to be removed out of your document.

**Skip\_Text** pages (true/false): Decide whether you want unnecessary text to be skipped.
