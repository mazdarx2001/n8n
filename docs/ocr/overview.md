The OCR Server consists of 5 different parts. The general **OCR Server Process** connected to the **Download Function with Link**, a **Detect pages function,** as well as a **merge and split PDF function.**  
  
In this documentation we will go over all of these functionalities and explain them in detail. The main reason for this API is to transform regular documents into OCR'd ones.

OCR stands for optical character recognition and transforms a regular pdf file into a machine encoded text file, so that meta data can be extracted. This API takes on the transformation-part of the process.

In the API we furthermore offer detect and merge functions, which we will explain later on.
