!!! warning "For testing only"
	The desktop app is a quick way to try out n8n. You shouldn't use it in production:

	* No access to community nodes
	* Nodes may not update to new versions
	* Version updates lag behind other platforms

!!! note "Keep in mind"
    If you have already installed n8n locally using `npm`, the desktop app will connect to the existing `sqlite` database.


!!! note "Tunnel credentials"
    The n8n desktop creates a tunnel in order to receive webhooks from external services such as Google. This tunnel is protected using a randomly generated combination of username and password. If you are asked for a login to your personal tunnel URL, you can find the generated credentials in the `n8n-desktop.env` file in the `.n8n` folder of your home directory.
