Now you've [got n8n running][] and built your [first workflow][], what's next? Here are some suggestions on how to continue your journey:

## Join the community!

## Build from one of over 1500 templates

Particularly when you're starting out, whatever you need an n8n workflow for has probably be done before. n8n templates are the distilled wisdom of our community, giving you the building blocks to experiment, tweak and tune your own workflows or quickly automate a common task. They're also a great way to learn.

[Browse or search the templates Â»](https://n8n.io/workflows/)

When you open a template, you will be prompted to supply any required credentials the workflow needs, making it even easier to get up and running. Most templates also include helpful notes for customizing the workflow.

## Follow our structured courses

Everyone has a different learning style, so we've developed two sets of structured learning courses to follow:
