# What's a tool in AI?

In AI, 'tools' has a specific meaning. Tools act like addons that your AI can use to access extra context or resources.

Here are a couple of other ways of expressing it:

> Tools are interfaces that an agent can use to interact with the world ([source](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/tools/){:target=_blank .external-link})

<!--  -->

> We can think of these tools as being almost like functions that your AI model can call ([source](https://www.udemy.com/course/chatgpt-and-langchain-the-complete-developers-masterclass/){:target=_blank .external-link})

## AI tools in n8n

n8n provides tool sub-nodes that you can connect to your AI agent. As well as providing some popular tools, such as [Wikipedia](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolwikipedia/) and [SerpAPI](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolserpapi/), n8n provides three especially powerful tools:

* [Custom n8n Workflow Tool](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/): use this to load any n8n workflow as a tool.
* [Custom Code Tool](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolcode/): write code that your agent can run.
* [HTTP Request Tool](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolhttprequest/): make calls to fetch a website or data from an API.

The next three examples highlight the Custom n8n Workflow Tool:

- [Chat with Google Sheets](/advanced-ai/examples/data-google-sheets/)  
- [Call an API to fetch data](/advanced-ai/examples/api-workflow-tool/)  
- [Set up a human fallback](/advanced-ai/examples/human-fallback/)
