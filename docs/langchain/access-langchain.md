# Access LangChain in n8n

/// info | Feature availability
This feature is available on Cloud and self-hosted n8n. In version [TODO: add version number] and above, LangChain functionality is included with n8n, and you don't need to do any special signup or installation steps.

If you want to test the latest AI functionality, the beta version is available. This may be unstable.
///

/// note | End of beta
The AI beta will close in 2024. If you're using a beta version, n8n will migrate you to the main n8n version.

docker run -it --rm --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n:ai-beta
```

If using data volumes:

```sh
docker volume create n8n_data

docker run -it --rm --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n:ai-beta
