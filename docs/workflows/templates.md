# Workflow templates

When creating a new workflow, you can choose whether to start with an empty workflow, or use an existing template.

Templates provide:

* A way to get started quickly: n8n might already have a template that does what you need.
* Examples of what you can build
* Best practices for creating your own workflows

### Use a workflow template

1. In the sidebar, click **Templates**.
2. Browse or search the workflow templates list.
3. Click a workflow to view more information. n8n opens the workflow details page.
4. On the workflow details page, click **Use this workflow**. n8n opens the workflow.
5. Click **Save** to add the workflow to your workflows.

!!! note "Workflow templates are available in 0.165.0 and above"
    Workflow templates are available on all flavors of n8n. If you can't access workflow templates in n8n, check that your n8n version is 0.165.0 or above, and check whether you are using a self-hosted or embedded version of n8n with templates disabled.

### Add your workflow to the library

You can submit your own workflows to n8n's template library.

1. In n8n, download your workflow JSON: 
    1. Open the workflow
    2. Click **Workflows** > **Download**.
2. [Log in](https://n8n.io/login) to your n8n dashboard.
3. Click **Share New Workflow**.
4. Enter your workflow details:
    * **Name**: this should be descriptive but simple. It will appear on the website and in app.
    * **Description**: tell users what the workflow does. Include any configuration or setup steps.
    * **Workflow code**: copy in the workflow JSON that you downloaded.
5. Click **Publish Workflow to Share**. n8n reviews all workflows before publishing them.
