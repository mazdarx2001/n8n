## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to GET a sample list of users from [reqres.in](https://reqres.in/), add a new user using a POST request, and update the user using a PATCH request. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/602) on the website. This example usage workflow uses the following two nodes.
- [Start](../../core-nodes/Start/README.md)
- [HTTP Request]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
