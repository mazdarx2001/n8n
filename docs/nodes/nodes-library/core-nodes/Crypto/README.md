	- HEX

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to encrypt data using the Crypto node. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/574) on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following two nodes.
- [Start](../../core-nodes/Start/README.md)
- [Crypto]()


The final workflow should look like the following image.
