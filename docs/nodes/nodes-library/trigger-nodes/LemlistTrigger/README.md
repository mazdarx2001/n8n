### 1. Lemlist Trigger

The Lemlist Trigger node will trigger the workflow when a lead sends a reply to the campaign `Docs campaign`. If you have a different campaign, use that instead.

1. First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the Lemlist Trigger node. You can find out how to do that [here](../../../credentials/Lemlist/README.md).
2. Select 'Email Replied' from the ***Events*** dropdown list.
3. Click on ***Add Field*** and select 'Campaign ID'.
4. Select 'Docs campaign' from the ***Campaign ID*** dropdown list.
5. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.

In the screenshot below, you will notice that the node returns the information of the reply that was sent by a lead. This output is passed on to the next node in the workflow.
