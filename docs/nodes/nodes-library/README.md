# Nodes Library

This section contains information about all the nodes in n8n. Each node documentation contains information on the available resources and operations along with an example workflow.

This library is divided into three sections for the different kinds of nodes:

- [Core Nodes](./core-nodes/README.md)
- [Nodes](./nodes/README.md)
- [Trigger Nodes](./trigger-nodes/README.md)
