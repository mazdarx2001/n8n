## Basic Operations

- Send message


## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to send a message to an [ActiveMQ](https://activemq.apache.org/) queue via AMQP Sender. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/512) on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following three nodes.
- [Start](../../core-nodes/Start/README.md)
- [Set](../../core-nodes/Set/README.md)
- [AMQP Sender]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
