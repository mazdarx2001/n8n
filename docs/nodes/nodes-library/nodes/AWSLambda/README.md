## Basic Operations

- Invoke a function

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to invoke a function using AWS Lambda. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/510) on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following two nodes.
- [Start](../../core-nodes/Start/README.md)
- [AWS Lambda]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

1. First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the AWS Lambda node. You can find out how to do that [here](../../../credentials/AWS/README.md).
2. Select the function you want to invoke from the *Function* dropdown list.
3. Click on *Execute Node* to run the workflow.
