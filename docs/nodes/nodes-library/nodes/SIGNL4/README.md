## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to send an alert on SIGNL4. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/441) on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following two nodes.
- [Start](../../core-nodes/Start/README.md)
- [SIGNL4]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
