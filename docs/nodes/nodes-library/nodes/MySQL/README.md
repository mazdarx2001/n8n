# MySQL

[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) is an open-source relational database management system. MySQL has stand-alone clients that allow users to interact directly with a MySQL database using SQL, but more often MySQL is used with other programs to implement applications that need relational database capability.

This workflow allows you to run an SQL query on a MySQL instance. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/492) on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following two nodes.
- [Start](../../core-nodes/Start/README.md)
- [MySQL]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
