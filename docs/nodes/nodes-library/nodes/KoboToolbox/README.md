# KoBoToolbox

[KoBoToolbox](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/) is a field survey / data collection tool that makes it easy to design interactive forms to be filled offfline from mobile devices. It is available both as a free cloud solution or as a self-hosted version.

::: tip ðŸ”‘ Credentials
You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/KoBoToolbox/README.md).

## Basic Operations

<Resource node="n8n-nodes-base.koBoToolbox" />

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to query some submissions for a particular form, and download associated binary attachments. It uses the following nodes:

- [Start](../../core-nodes/Start/README.md)
- [KoBoToolbox]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

![A simple workflow with the KoBoToolbox node](./workflow.png)

### 1. Start node

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

### 2. KoBoToolbox node (submission: query)

This node will fetch form submissions for a given form ID.

1. First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the KoBoToolbox node. You can find out how to do that [here](../../../credentials/KoBoToolbox/README.md).
1. Select 'Submission' from the ***Resource*** dropdown list.
1. Select 'Query' from the ***Operation*** dropdown list.
1. Provide a valid KoBoToolbox form ID for your KoBoToolbox instance in the ***Form ID*** field (get it from the URL of your form view in the KoBoToolbox UI - e.g. a form at `https://kf.kobotoolbox.org/#/forms/aJ6uJj8zhnQPij3myN4xRm/landing` would have an id of `aJ6uJj8zhnQPij3myN4xRm`), or simply look it up from the dropdown list that should auto-populate.
1. You may tweak the query options such as max returned records and search offset.
1. You may also tweak the general options, affecting the formatting, such as whether to download any binary attachments, or apply some generic field reformatting.
1. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.

In the screenshot below, you will notice that the node returns a number of submissions.

## Available Operations

This node lets you perform the following operations:

- Forms:
  - Get a single form definition
  - Get all or query available forms
- Hooks:
  - Get a single hook definition for a given form
  - Get all hooks for a given form
  - Get the execution logs for a given hook
  - Retry all failed executions for a given hook
  - Retry a single failed execution for given hook
- Submissions:
  - Delete a single submission
  - Get a single submission
  - Get all / query submissions for a given form
  - Get the validation status of a single submission
  - Update the validation status of a single submission

## Options

### Query Options

The Query Submission operation supports a few query options:

- In the main section of the ***Parameters*** panel, the ***Start*** and ***Limit*** will control the index offset to start the query from (to use the API pagination logic), and the max number of records to return. Note that the API always has a limit of 30,000 returned records, whatver the value you provide.
- In the ***Query Options*** section, you may activate the following parameters:
  - The ***Query*** option will let you specify various filter predicates, in MongoDB's JSON query format. For example: `{"status": "success", "_submission_time": {"$lt": "2021-11-01T01:02:03"}}` will query for all submissions with the value `success` for the field `status`, and submitted before November 1st, 2021, 01:02:03. If not specified, all submissions will be returned.
  - The ***Fields*** option will let you specifiy the list of fields you want to fetch, to make the response lighter. If not specified, all fields will be returned.
  - The ***Sort*** option will let you provide a list of sorting criteria, in MongoDB JSON format. For example, `{"status": 1, "_submission_time": -1}` will specifiy a sort order by ascending status, and then descending submission time.
  - More details about these options can be found in the [Formhub API docs](https://github.com/SEL-Columbia/formhub/wiki/Formhub-Access-Points-(API)#api-parameters)

### Submission Options

All operations that return form submission data will offer options to tweak the response, in particular:

- Download options will let you download any attachment linked to each particular form submissions, such as pictures and videos. It will also let you select the naming pattern, and the file size to download (if available - typically for images). See an example with downloads enabled:

![Downloads](./downloads.png)

- Formatting options will perform some reformatting as described below

#### About Reformatting

The default JSON format for KoBoToolbox submission data is sometimes hard to deal with, because it is not schema-aware, and all fields are therefore returned as strings.

This node provides a lightweight opinionated reformatting logic, enabled with the ***Reformat?*** parameter, available on all operations that return form submissions, i.e. the submission query, get, and the attachment download operations.

When enabled, the reformatting will:

- Reorganize the JSON into a multi-level hierarchy following the form's groups. By default, question grouping hierarchy is materialized by a `/` character in the field names, e.g. `Group1/Question1`. With reformatting enabled, these will be rerganized into `Group1.Question1`, as nested JSON objects.
- Rename fields to trim `_` (not supported by many downstream systems)
- Parse all geospatial fields (Point, Line, and Area question types) into their standard GeoJSON equivalent
- Split all fields matching any of the the ***Multiselect Mask*** wildcard masks into an array. Since the multi-select fields appear as space-separated strings, they cannot be guessed algorithmically, so a field naming mask needs to be provided. The masks are provided as a comma-separated list supporting the `*` wildcard.
- Convert all fields matching any of the ***Number Mask*** wildcard masks into a JSON float.

See below the effects of the reformatting on a few sample submissions - notice the field renaming, the geolocation parsing, the array for multi-valued field, the structured `meta` object:

Here's a detailed example in JSON:

With reformatting enabled, and the appropriate masks for multi-select and number formatting (e.g. `Crops_*` and `*_sqm` respecitvely), it will be parsed into:
