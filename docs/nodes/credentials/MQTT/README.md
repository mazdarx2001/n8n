# MQTT

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes with MQTT.
- [MQTT](../../nodes-library/nodes/MQTT/README.md)
- [MQTT Trigger](../../nodes-library/trigger-nodes/MQTTTrigger/README.md)

## Prerequisites

You need to have a MQTT broker installed.

## Using MQTT

Use your Protocol, Host, Port, Username, and Password as the MQTT Trigger credential data in n8n.

Optionally, you can enable SSL and provide a CA or Client certificate.
