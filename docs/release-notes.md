This release contains new features and bug fixes.

<div class="n8n-new-features" markdown>

#### Improved execution queue handling

We are [exposing new execution queue metrics](/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/prometheus/) to give users more visibility of the queue length. This helps to inform decisions on horizontal scaling, based on queue status. We have also made querying executions faster. 

</div>

<div class="n8n-new-features" markdown>

#### New credentials for the HTTP Request node

We added credential support for Datadog, Dynatrace, Elastic Security, Filescan, Iris, and Malcore to the HTTP Request node making it easier to use existing credentials. 

</div>


We also made it easier to select workflows as tools when working with AI agents by implementing a new `workflow selector` parameter type.

/// warning | Breaking change
Calling `$(...).last()` (or `(...).first()` or `$(...).all()`) without arguments now returns the last item (or first or all items) of the output that connects two nodes. Previously, it returned the item/items of the first output of that node. Refer to the [breaking changes log](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md#1470){:target=_blank .external-link} for details.

This release contains new features, node enhancements, and bug fixes.

/// note | Backup recommended
Although this release doesn't include a breaking change, it is a significant update including database migrations. n8n recommends backing up your data before updating to this version.
///

/// Note | Credential sharing required for manual executions
Instance owners and admins: you will see changes if you try to manually execute a workflow where the credentials aren't shared with you. Manual workflow executions now use the same permissions checks as production executions, meaning you can't do a manual execution of a workflow if you don't have access to the credentials. Previously, owners and admins could do manual executions without credentials being shared with them. To resolve this, the credential creator needs to [share the credential](/credentials/credential-sharing/) with you.
///

<div class="n8n-new-features" markdown>

#### New feature: Projects

With projects and roles, you can give your team access to collections of workflows and credentials, rather than having to share each workflow and credential individually. Simultaneously, you tighten security by limiting access to people on the relevant team.
<br /><br />
Refer to the [RBAC](/user-management/rbac/) documentation for information on creating projects and using roles.
<br /><br />
The number of projects and role types vary depending on your plan. Refer to [Pricing](https://n8n.io/pricing/){:target=_blank .external-link} for details.

#### New node: Slack Trigger

This release adds a trigger node for Slack. Refer to the [Slack trigger documentation](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slacktrigger/) for details.

</div>

### Other highlights

* Improved [memory support for OpenAI assistants](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.openai/#using-memory-with-openai-assistants).

### Rolling back to a previous version

If you update to this version, then decide you need to role back:

Self-hosted n8n:

1. Delete any RBAC projects you created.
2. Revert the database migrations using `n8n db:revert`.

Cloud: contact [help@n8n.io](mailto:help@n8n.io).

#### New feature: Ask AI in the HTTP node

You can now ask AI to help create API requests in the HTTP Request node:

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Ask AI**.
1. Enter the **Service** and **Request** you want to use. For example, to use the NASA API to get their picture of the day, enter `NASA` in **Service** and `get picture of the day` in **Request**.
1. Check the parameters: the AI tries to fill them out, but you may still need to adjust or correct the configuration.

Self-hosted users need to [enable AI features and provide their own API keys](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/ai/)

This release contains new nodes, node enhancements, new features, and bug fixes.

<div class="n8n-new-features" markdown>

#### New nodes and improved experience for working with files

This release includes a major overhaul of nodes relating to files (binary data).

There are now three key nodes dedicated to handling binary data files:

- [Read/Write Files from Disk](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.filesreadwrite/) to read and write files from/to the machine where n8n is running.
- [Convert to File](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.converttofile/) to take input data and output it as a file.
- [Extract From File](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.extractfromfile/) to get data from a binary format and convert it to JSON.

n8n has moved support for iCalendar, PDF, and spreadsheet formats into these nodes, and removed the iCalendar, Read PDF, and Spreadsheet File nodes. There are still standalone nodes for [HTML](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.html/) and [XML](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.xml/).

</div>

<div class="n8n-new-features" markdown>

#### New node: Qdrant vector store

This release adds support for [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/){:target=_blank .external-link} with the Qdrant vector store node.

Read n8n's [Qdrant vector store node documentation](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstoreqdrant/)

## LangChain in n8n (beta)  

**Release date:** 2023-10-04

This release introduces support for building with LangChain in n8n. 

With n8n's LangChain nodes you can build AI-powered functionality within your workflows. The LangChain nodes are configurable, meaning you can choose your preferred agent, LLM, memory, and other components. Alongside the LangChain nodes, you can connect any n8n node as normal: this means you can integrate your LangChain logic with other data sources and services.

Read more:

* This is a beta release, and not yet available in the main product. Follow the instructions in [Access LangChain in n8n](/langchain/access-langchain/) to try it out. Self-hosted and Cloud options are available.
* Learn how LangChain concepts map to n8n nodes in [LangChain concepts in n8n](/langchain/langchain-n8n/).
* Browse n8n's new [Cluster nodes](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/). This is a new set of node types that allows for multiple nodes to work together to configure each other.
* If you want to take a look at the code, it's available on the [ai-beta](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/ai-beta){:target=_blank .external-link} in the n8n repository. Note that it may move in the future.
