# Data mapping

Data mapping means referencing data from previous nodes. It doesn't include changing (transforming) data, just referencing it.

You can map data in the following ways:

* Using the expressions editor. Refer to [expressions](/code-examples/expressions/) for more information.
* By dragging and dropping data from the **INPUT** table into parameters. This generates the expression for you.

## How to drag and drop data

1. Run your workflow to load data.
2. Open the node where you need to map data.
3. Make sure the **INPUT** view is in **Table** layout.
4. Click and hold a table heading.
5. Drag the table heading into the parameter field where you want to use the data.
