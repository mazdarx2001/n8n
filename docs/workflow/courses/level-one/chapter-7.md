# Test your knowledge

Congratulations, you finished the WF² Course Level 1!

You've learned a lot about workflow automation and built your first business workflow. Why not showcase your skills?

You can test your knowledge by taking a **quiz**, which consists of questions about the theoretical concepts and workflows covered in this course.

    - You need to have at least 80% correct answers in each part to pass the quiz.
    - You can take the quiz as many times as you want.
    - There is no time limit on answering the quiz questions.
