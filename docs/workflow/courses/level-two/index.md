# Introduction

Welcome to the **n8n Course Level 2**!

## Is this course right for me?

This course is for you if you:

- Want to automate somewhat complex business processes.
- Want to dive deeper into n8n after taking the [Level 1 course](/workflow/courses/level-one){:target="_blank" .external}.

## What will I learn in this course?

The focus in this course is on working with data. You will learn how to:

- Use the data structure of n8n correctly.
- Process different data types (for example, XML, HTML, date, time, and binary data).
- Merge data from different sources (for example, a database, spreadsheet, or CRM).
- Use functions and JavaScript code in the [Function node](/workflow/integrations/core-nodes/workflow-nodes-base.function){:target="_blank" .external}.
- Deal with error workflows and workflow errors.

You will learn all this by completing short practical exercises after the theoretical explanations, and building a business workflow following instructions.

## What do I need to get started?

To follow along this course (at a comfortable pace) you will need the following:

- **n8n set up**: You can use the [self-hosted version](/hosting/installation/npm/){:target="_blank" .external}, [n8n.cloud](/hosting/installation/cloud/){:target="_blank" .external}, or the [desktop app](/hosting/installation/desktop-app/){:target="_blank" .external}.
- **A user ID**: [Sign up here](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/HQoQ7nXg){:target="_blank" .external} to get your unique ID and other credentials you will need in the course.
- **Basic n8n skills**. We strongly recommend taking the [Level 1 course](/workflow/courses/level-one/){:target="_blank" .external} prior to this one.
- **Basic JavaScript understanding**.

## How long does the course take?

Completing the course should take around **two hours**. You do not have to complete it in one go, feel free to take breaks and resume whenever you are ready.

## How do I complete the course?

There are two milestones in this course that test your knowledge of what you have learned in the lessons:
