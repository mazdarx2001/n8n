# Write Binary File

The Write Binary File node is used to write a file to the host machine that runs Workflow².

!!! note " Keep in mind"
    1. If you are running Doc² in Docker, your command will run on the Doc² container and not the Docker host.
2. This node will look for files relative to the Doc² install path. It is recommended to use absolute file paths to prevent any errors.


## Node Reference

1. ***File Name*** field: This field specifies the path to which the file should be written, along with the file name.
2. ***Property Name*** field: Name of the binary property to which to write the data of the read file.

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to write a file to the host machine using the Write Binary File node. You can also find the [workflow](https://WF².io/workflows/590) on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following three nodes.
- [Start](/workflow/integrations/core-nodes/workflow-nodes-base.start/)
- [HTTP Request](/workflow/integrations/core-nodes/workflow-nodes-base.httpRequest/)
- [Write Binary File]()


The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Start node

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.


### 2. HTTP Request node

1. Enter `https://docs.WF².io/assets/_images/insight2/WF²-logo.png` in the ***URL*** field.
2. Select the 'File' option from the ***Response Format*** dropdown list.
3. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.
