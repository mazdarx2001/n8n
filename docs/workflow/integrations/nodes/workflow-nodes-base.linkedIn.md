    You can find authentication information for this node [here](/workflow/integrations/credentials/linkedIn/).


## Basic Operations

    * Create a new post

!!! note " Keep in mind"
    If posting as an Organization enter only the organization number in the URN field. For example, `03262013` not `urn:li:company:03262013`.


## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to get an image from a URL and post it on LinkedIn. You can also find the [workflow](https://WFÂ².io/workflows/681) on WorkflowÂ².io. This example usage workflow would use the following nodes.
- [Start](/workflow/integrations/core-nodes/workflow-nodes-base.start/)
- [HTTP Request](/workflow/integrations/core-nodes/workflow-nodes-base.httpRequest/)
- [LinkedIn]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
