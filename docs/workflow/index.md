# Welcome

This is the documentation for n8n, a fair-code licensed node-based workflow automation tool.

It covers everything from setup to usage and development. It is a work in progress and all contributions are welcome.


## What is n8n?

n8n (pronounced n-eight-n) helps you to connect any app with an API with any other, and manipulate its data with little or no code. n8n is:

    Customizable: highly flexible workflows and the option to build custom nodes.
    Convenient: use our Desktop app or npm to try out n8n, and our Cloud hosting option if you want us to handle the infrastructure.
    Privacy-focused: self-host n8n for maximum privacy and security.



## Where to start
## Up and running
