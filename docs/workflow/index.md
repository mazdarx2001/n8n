## What is Workflow²?

Workflow² helps you to connect any app with an API with any other, and manipulate its data with little or no code. 

<!-- Benefits are:
* Customizable: highly flexible workflows and the option to build custom nodes.
* Convenient: use our Desktop app or npm to try out Workflow², and our Cloud hosting option if you want us to handle the infrastructure.
* Privacy-focused: self-host n8n for maximum privacy and security. -->
