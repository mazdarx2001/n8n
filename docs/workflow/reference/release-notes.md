This release focuses on bug fixes and node enhancements, with one new feature, and one breaking change to the GraphQL node.

### Breaking change to GraphQL node

The GraphQL node now errors when the response includes an error. If you use this node, you can choose to:

* Do nothing: a GraphQL response containing an error will now cause the workflow to fail.
* Update your GraphQL node settings: set **Continue on Fail** to true to allow the workflow to continue even when the GraphQL response contains an error.

### New features

You can now download binary data from individual nodes in your workflow.

For a comprehensive list of changes, view the [commits](https://github.com/WF²-io/WF²/compare/WF²%400.167.0...WF²@0.168.0) for this version.<br />
**Release date:** 2022-03-14

User management in Doc² allows you to invite people to work in your self-hosted Doc² instance. It includes:

## WF²@0.167.0

For a comprehensive list of changes, view the [commits](https://github.com/WF²-io/WF²/compare/WF²%400.166.0...WF²@0.167.0) for this version.<br />
**Release date:** 2022-03-13

### Highlights

#### Luxon and JMESPath

0.167.0 adds support for two new libraries:

* [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/): a JavaScript library for working with date and time
* [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/): a query language for JSON

You can use Luxon and JMESPath in the code editor and in expressions.

#### New expressions variables

We've added two new variables to simplify working with date and time in expressions:

* `$now`: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp. Equivalent to DateTime.now().
* `$today`: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp, rounded down to the day. Equivalent to DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 }).

#### Negative operations in If and Switch nodes

Made it easier to perform negative operations on strings.

This release adds one new operation for numbers:

* Is Not Empty

And the following new operations for strings:

* Not Ends With
* Regex Not Match
* Not Starts With
* Is Not Empty

Additionally, Regex is now labelled Regex Match.

#### New node: Redis Trigger

Added a Redis Trigger node, so you can now start workflows based on a Redis event.

* [Redis Trigger:](/workflow/integrations/trigger-nodes/workflow-nodes-base.redisTrigger/) Added a Redis Trigger node.

### Core functionality

- Added support for [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/) and [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/).
- Added two new expressions variables, `$now` and `$today`.
- Added more negative operations for numbers and strings.
- Added a link to the course from the help menu.

### Nodes


* [Facebook Graph API:](/workflow/integrations/nodes/workflow-nodes-base.facebookGraphApi/) Added suport for Facebook Graph API 13.
* [Hubspot:](/workflow/integrations/nodes/workflow-nodes-base.hubspot/) Added suport for private app token authentication.
* [MongoDB:](/workflow/integrations/nodes/workflow-nodes-base.mongoDb/) Added the aggregate operation.
* [Redis Trigger:](/workflow/integrations/trigger-nodes/workflow-nodes-base.redisTrigger/) Added a Redis Trigger node.

* [Strapi:](/workflow/integrations/nodes/workflow-nodes-base.strapi/) Added support for Strapi 4.
* [WordPress:](/workflow/integrations/nodes/workflow-nodes-base.wordpress/) Added status as an option to getAll post requests.


### Bugfixes

- The Google Calendar node now correctly applies timezones when creating, updating, and scheduling all day events.
