There is a default schema in place which is used by default and can handle most of the Invoice/ Table layouts. For some certain Invoice / Table layouts there are special (custom) layouts in place and certainly there could be more if there are any special needs within your Organisation.

The default schema can recognize values listed in table below. If any field which is marked as required in the table below is missing, this row cannot be recognized as a valid row.

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Name</strong></td><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td><strong>Required</strong></td></tr><tr><td>POSITION</td><td>string</td><td>false</td></tr><tr><td>DESCRIPTION</td><td>string</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>ITEM_NUMBER</td><td>string</td><td>false</td></tr><tr><td>QUANTITY</td><td>number</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>UNIT_PRICE</td><td>currency</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL_AMOUNT</td><td>currency</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>PURCHASE_ORDER</td><td>string</td><td>false</td></tr></tbody></table>

TE² plugin backend intelligence is executing and optimizing the data/ table view which can then be validated or corrected by user if needed. Even if most tables are recognized and can be executed there are some limitations in the technology, meaning that certain kinds of tables cannot be recognized.

The following characteristics are some reasons on why tables can not be extracted:

1. Multi-line tables.
2. Mixed separation of columns (grid and no grid mix).
3. Table grid overlapping.
4. Too much distance between the column headers and the actual lines.

In any case, tables will be analysed by PolyDocs GmbH i. Gr. in order to determine possibility and viability of the table extraction.
