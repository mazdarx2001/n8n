### Step 3: 

Open Workflow Management
Drag & Drop or upload the plugin zip files into the “Import Plugin” area to auto-install the plugin.

Make sure that file name is exactly “fellowtable2extractionplugin.zip” and that the files are not renamed (eg by downloading multiple times) as Ephesoft cannot recognize files with another name.
