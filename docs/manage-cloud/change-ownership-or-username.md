## Change instance ownership

You can change the ownership of an instance by navigating to the **Settings** page in the owner's account and editing the **Email** field. After making the changes, scroll down and press **Save**.
Note that for the change to be effective, the new email address can't be linked to any other n8n account.

Changing emails will change the owner of the instance, the email you log in with, and the email your invoices and general communication gets sent to.

## Change instance username

It's not currently possible to change usernames.
If you want your instance to have a different name you will need to create a new account and transfer your work into it. [Here](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/export-import/) you can see how you can transfer your work no a new n8n instance.
