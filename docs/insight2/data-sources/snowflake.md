# Snowflake

Insight² can connect to Snowflake databases to read and write data.

- [Snowflake](#snowflake)
	- [Connection](#connection)
	- [Querying Snowflake](#querying-snowflake)

## Connection

Please make sure the host/ip of the database is accessible from your VPC if you have self-hosted Insight. If you are using Insight² cloud, please whitelist our IP. You can find snowflake docs on network policies **[here](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/network-policies.html)**.


To add a new Snowflake database, click on the `+` button on data sources panel at the left-bottom corner of the app editor. Select Snowflake from the modal that pops up.

Insight² requires the following to connect to your Snowflake database.

- **Account**
- **Username**
- **Password**

You can also configure for **[additional optional parameters](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/nodejs-driver-use.html#additional-connection-options)**.

## Querying Snowflake

Click on `+` button of the query manager at the bottom panel of the editor and select the database added in the previous step as the datasource. Query manager then can be used to write raw SQL queries.
