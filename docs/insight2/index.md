# Welcome

![](/_images/insight2/Logo_Insight2.png)

Insight² is an **open-source no-code framework** to build and deploy custom internal tools. Insight² can connect to your data sources such as databases ( PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, Elasticsearch, Firestore, DynamoDB, Redis and more ), API endpoints ( Insight² supports OAuth2 authorization ) and external services ( Stripe, Slack, Google Sheets, Airtable and more ). Once the data sources are connected, Insight² can run queries on these data sources to fetch and update data. The data fetched from data sources can be visualised and modified using the UI widgets such as tables, charts, forms, etc.

## How Insight² works

**Insight² has just 3 fundamental principles for building apps:**

- **Connect to data sources:** Connect to your existing data sources such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, Firestore, Stripe, Google Sheets, API endpoints, etc.
- **Build queries:** Insight² comes with query builders for all supported data sources. Insight² also supports the use of custom JavaScript code to transform the query results.
- **Customise widgets:** Widgets are the UI components that can be edited using Insight's visual app builder ( Eg: tables, charts, forms, etc ). Widgets have events such as `on click`, `on row selected`, `on page changed`, etc. Every UI widget has a dark version.

Insight² binds together the data sources, queries and widgets to convert business logic into custom applications.
