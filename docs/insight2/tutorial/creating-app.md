The main components of an app:

- **[Widgets](https://docs.tooljet.com/docs/tutorial/adding-widget)** - UI components such as tables, buttons, dropdowns.
- **[Data sources](https://docs.tooljet.com/docs/tutorial/adding-a-datasource)** - Insight can connect to databases, APIs and external services to fetch and modify data.
- **[Queries](https://docs.tooljet.com/docs/tutorial/building-queries)** - Queries are used to access the connected data sources.
