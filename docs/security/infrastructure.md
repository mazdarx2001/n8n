# Application Infrastructure


### Open ports
* 443

### Communication with the Database
Kubernetes and our Databases are inside the same VPC. We only access the database via the local IP, this way the transferred data never leaves the local network.
Additionally, we only use SSL secured connections to comunicate with the database.

### Spaces
The uploaded documents are stored in a Space. The trafic is secured via ssl and multiple keys are required to access the stored files.

### Trafic Security
We only allow https secured connections to comunicate with our Servers. This ensures that the transferd data is encrypted and secure.

## On-Prem Infor
With our On-Prem solution, you don't have to open any ports. This ensures that the security of your network is not compromised.
