# Application Infrastructure


### Open port
* 443

### Communication with the Database
Kubernetes and our Databases are inside the same VPC. We only access the database via the local IP, this way the transferred data never leaves the local network.
Additionally, we only use SSL secured connections to communicate with the database.

### Spaces
The uploaded documents are stored in a Space. The traffic is secured via SSL and multiple keys are required to access the stored files.

### Traffic Security
We only allow https secured connections to communicate with our servers. This ensures that the transferred data is encrypted and secure. 

## Infor Cloud

## Infor On-Prem 
With our On-Prem solution, you don't have to open any ports. This ensures that the security of your network is not compromised.
