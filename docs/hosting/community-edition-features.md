# Community edition features

The community edition runs with almost the complete feature set of n8n. The exceptions are listed here. 

Community edition doesn't include these features:

- [Environments](/source-control-environments/) 
- [Version control using Git](/source-control-environments/) 
- [External storage for binary data](/hosting/scaling/external-storage/) 
- [Log streaming](/log-streaming/) ([Logging](/hosting/logging-monitoring/logging/) _is_ included) 
- [Multi-main mode](/hosting/scaling/queue-mode/#multi-main-setup) ([Queue mode](/hosting/scaling/queue-mode/) _is_ included) 
- [External secrets](/external-secrets/) 
- SSO ([SAML](/hosting/securing/set-up-sso/), [LDAP](/user-management/ldap/)) 
- [Projects](/user-management/rbac/projects/) 
- [Workflow history](/workflows/history/) 
- Sharing ([workflows](/workflows/sharing/), [credentials](/credentials/credential-sharing/)) (All workflows and credentials are solely accessible to the instance owner and the user who creates them) 

The above features are either available on Starter, Pro or Enterprise plans (including the self-hosted Enterprise edition).
