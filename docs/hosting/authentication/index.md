# Authentication

n8n has built-in user management. This is the recommended user authentication and management solution for most scenarios.

This section includes guidance on setting up the following authentication methods:

* Built-in [self-hosted user management](/hosting/authentication/user-management-self-hosted/)
* [Basic auth](/hosting/authentication/basic-auth/)
* [JWT](/hosting/authentication/jwt/)

For usage guidance on user management, refer to [User management](/user-management/).

For LDAP setup information, refer to [LDAP](/user-management/ldap/).
