!!! note "Cloud IP addresses"
        Currently it is `20.79.72.105`, however this is subject to change. The NAT addresses are `20.79.227.226` and `20.79.72.36`, but this is also subject to change.
    Recommended practice is to whitelist `20.79.72.0/24`, but if more strict measures are needed, at minimum `20.79.72.105`, `20.79.72.36`, and `20.79.227.226` must be whitelisted.
