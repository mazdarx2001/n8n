## Security

By default, Doc² can be accessed by everybody. This is okay if you only have it running
locally but if you deploy it on a server which is accessible from the web, you have
to make sure that Doc² is protected.

### Basic auth

Right now we have very basic protection in place using basic-auth. It can be activated
by setting the following environment variables:

```bash
export N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE=true
export N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER=<USER>
export N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=<PASSWORD>
```

### JWT

There is also limited support for JWT based authentication. If enabled, Doc² will verify the token with the provided JSON Web Key Set URI. It can be configured through the following environment variables:

```bash
export N8N_JWT_AUTH_ACTIVE=true
export N8N_JWT_AUTH_HEADER=<HEADER>
export N8N_JWKS_URI=<URI>
```
Keep in mind that there is currently no built-in way of passing down the Token in the request, so to use JWT you have to have the token in the request manually.
