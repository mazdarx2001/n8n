# 6. Notifying the team

In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to send messages to a Discord channel using the *Discord node*.


Now that you have a calculated summary of the booked orders, you need to notify Nathan‚Äôs team in their Discord channel. n8n has a ***Discord node*** that allows you to send messages.

::: tip üí° Communication nodes
You can replace the *Discord node* with another communication app. n8n also has nodes for [*Slack*](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/) and [*Mattermost*](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mattermost/).
:::

In your workflow, add a *Discord node* connected to the *Function node*. In the *Discord node* window, configure the parameters:
::: v-pre
- *Webhook URL:* [https://discord.com/api/webhooks/862290560479526932/qmSLXOr0RWmP9i7OSPJ-p08mFZbe4CBkxxg8IjUS0Mixxi-VjeLXONY8ZorIqjgILT0F](https://discord.com/api/webhooks/862290560479526932/qmSLXOr0RWmP9i7OSPJ-p08mFZbe4CBkxxg8IjUS0Mixxi-VjeLXONY8ZorIqjgILT0F)
- *Text (Expression):* This week we have {{$json["bookedOrders"]}} booked orders.

Now execute the *Discord node* and if all works well, you should get a message in Discord:

Amazing! Think of how much time Nathan can save up thanks to this workflow! There‚Äôs only one small step left to make it even more effective ‚Äì scheduling the workflow to run every week. You‚Äôll learn how to do this in the next lesson.

## What's next?

**Nathan üôã**: Incredible, you've saved me so many hours of tedious work already! Now I can simply execute this workflow when I need it. I just need to remember to run it every Monday morning at 9 am...

**You üë©‚Äçüîß**: Don't worry about that, you can actually schedule the workflow to run on a specific day, time, or interval. I'll set this up in the next step.
