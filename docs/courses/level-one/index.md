# Level one: Introduction

Welcome to the **n8n Course Level 1**!


## Is this course right for me?

This course introduces you to the fundamental concepts within n8n and develops your low-code automation expertise.

This course is for you if you:

- Are starting to use n8n for the first time.
- Are looking for some extra help creating your first workflow.
- Want to automate processes in your personal or working life.


## What will I learn in this course?

We believe in learning by doing. You can expect some theoretical information about the basic concepts and components of n8n, followed by practice of building workflows step by step.

By the end of this course you will know:

- How to set up n8n and navigate the Editor UI.
- How n8n structures data.
- How to configure different node parameters and add credentials.
- When and how to use conditional logic in workflows.
- How to schedule and control workflows.
- How to import, download, and share workflows with others.

You will build two workflows:

- A two-node workflow to get articles from Hacker News
- A seven-node workflow to help your client get records from a data warehouse, filter them, make calculations, and notify team members about the results

## What do I need to get started?

1. **n8n set up**: You can use the [self-hosted version](/hosting/installation/npm/){:target="_blank" .external}, or [n8n Cloud](/manage-cloud/overview/){:target="_blank" .external}.
2. **A user ID**: [Sign up here](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/PDEMrevI){:target="_blank" .external} to get your unique ID and other credentials you will need in the course.
3. Basic knowledge of JavaScript and [APIs](https://n8n.io/blog/what-are-apis-how-to-use-them-with-no-code/){:target="_blank" .external} would be helpful, but isn't necessary.
4. An [account on the n8n community forum](/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.1/){:target="_blank" .external} if you wish to receive a profile badge and avatar upon successful completion

## How long does the course take?

Completing the course should take around **two hours**. You don't have to complete it in one go; feel free to take breaks and resume whenever you are ready.
