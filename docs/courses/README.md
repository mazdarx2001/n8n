If you’ve found your way here, it means you’re about to get serious about your interest in automation. Maybe you got tired of manually entering data into the same spreadsheet every day, of clicking through a series of tabs and buttons to get that one piece of information you need, of managing tens of different tools and systems.

Whatever the reason, one thing is clear: you shouldn’t spend precious time doing things that don’t spark joy and don’t contribute to your growth, in both your personal and professional life. 

These tasks should and can be automated! And you don't even need advanced technical knowledge or excellent coding skills to do this: with no-code tools like n8n, automation feels like childsplay.
