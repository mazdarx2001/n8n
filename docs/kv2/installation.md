The association and configuration part of the plugin is now done. Note that you have to re-start Transact server before you can start using the plugin.

**Step 6: Deactivate extraction rules for not needed index fields.**

In order to deactivate the extraction rules in every field you have to go through every document type. So, when you open the batch class you will see the following list:

![](/_images/doc2/image-26-1024x411.png)

Now, start from the top and go through every document type following exactly the same steps.

As an example, let's start with document type INVOICE\_DE. So, open the folder and you will see al index fields available.

![](/_images/doc2/image-27-1024x424.png)

Now, we can start with for instance the delivery date and you will need to deactivate the fields by checking off the box in the last column and clicking on "Apply" and "Deploy". It should look like this:

![](/_images/doc2/image-28-1024x494.png)

Please deactivate the rules for all index fields but CREDIT\_NOTE, CURRENCY, IBAN\_EXTRACTED, INVOICE and VAT\_NO\_EXTRACTED.

**Step 7: Import the feedback fields.**

Please use this zip file for the import:

[INVOICE\_DE\_FieldTypes-1](https://docs.cloudintegration.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/INVOICE_DE_FieldTypes-1.zip)[Download](https://docs.cloudintegration.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/INVOICE_DE_FieldTypes-1.zip)

Now go through every document type and use the box underneath for "Import Index Field(s)" to select or drag and drop the zip file:
