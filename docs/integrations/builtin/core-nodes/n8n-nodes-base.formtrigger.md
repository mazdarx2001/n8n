# n8n Form trigger

Use the n8n Form trigger to start a workflow when a user submits a form, taking the input data from the form. The node generates the form web page for you to use.

## Build and test workflows

While building or testing a workflow, use the **Test URL**. Using a test URL ensures that you can view the incoming data in the editor UI, which is useful for debugging. 

There are two ways to test:

* Select **Test Step**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the node, but not the rest of the workflow.
* Select **Test Workflow**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the workflow.

## Production workflows

When your workflow is ready, switch to using the **Production URL**. You can then activate your workflow, and n8n runs it automatically when a user submits the form.

When working with a production URL, ensure that you have saved and activated the workflow. Data flowing through the Form trigger isn't visible in the editor UI with the production URL.

## Node parameters

These are the main node configuration fields.

### Form URLs

The Form trigger node has two URLs: test URL and production URL. n8n displays the URLs at the top of the node panel. Select **Test URL** or **Production URL** to toggle which URL n8n displays.

* **Test**: n8n registers a test webhook when you select **Test Step** or **Test Workflow**, if the workflow isn't active. When you call the URL, n8n displays the data in the workflow.
* **Production**: n8n registers a production webhook when you activate the workflow. When using the production URL, n8n doesn't display the data in the workflow. You can still view workflow data for a production execution: select the **Executions** tab in the workflow, then select the workflow execution you want to view.

### Form Path

Set a custom slug for the form.

### Form Title

n8n displays the **Form Title** as the webpage title and main `h1` title on the form.

### Form Description

n8n displays the **Form Description** as a subtitle below the main `h1` title on the form.

### Form Fields

Create the question fields for your form. Select **Add Form Field** to add a new field.

Every field has the following settings:

* **Field Label**: 
* **Field Type**: this can be **Date**, **Dropdown List**, **Number**, **Password**, **Text**, or **Textarea**.
	* If you select **Date**, n8n includes a date picker in the form.
	* If you select **Dropdown List**, n8n displays **Field Options** in the node: use this to add the dropdown options. By default, the dropdown is single-choice. To make it multiple choice, activate the **Multiple Choice** toggle in **Field Options**.
* **Required Field**: activate this toggle to require users to complete this field on the form.

### Respond When

Choose when n8n sends a response to the form submission. You can respond when:

* **Form Is Submitted**: send a response to the user as soon as they submit the form.
* **Workflow Finishes**: use this if you want the workflow to complete its execution before you send a response to the user. If the workflow errors, it sends a response to the user telling them there was a problem submitting the form.
* **Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node**: the Form trigger node responds as defined in the [Respond to Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook/) node.

## Node options

Select **Add Option** to view more configuration options.

* **Form Response**: choose how to respond when the user submits the form. Select **Respond With** > **Form Submitted Text** to show a message to the user, or **Respond With** > **Redirect URL** to send the user to a new page.
* **Append n8n Attribution**: toggle this off to hide the **Form automated with n8n** message on the form.
