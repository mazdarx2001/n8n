# Read Binary Files

The Read Binary Files node reads files from the host machine that runs n8n.

!!! note "Examples and templates"

## File locations

If you run n8n in Docker, your command runs in the n8n container and not the Docker host.

This node looks for files relative to the n8n install path. n8n recommends using absolute file paths to prevent any errors.
