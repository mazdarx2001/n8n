## Options

The node options available depend on the operation.

### Read File(s) From Disk

* **File Extension**: set the extension for the file in the node output.
* **File Name**: set the name for the file in the node output.
* **MIME Type**: set the file's MIME type in the node output.
* **Put Output File in Field**: set the name of the field in the output data to contain the file.

**Append**: enable this to append to an existing file, instead of creating a new one.

## File locations

If you run n8n in Docker, your command runs in the n8n container and not the Docker host.

This node looks for files relative to the n8n install path. n8n recommends using absolute file paths to prevent any errors.
