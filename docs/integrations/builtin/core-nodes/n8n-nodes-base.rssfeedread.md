# RSS Read

The RSS Read node is used to read data from RSS feeds published on the internet.

/// note | Examples and templates
For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [RSS Read integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/rss-read/){:target=_blank .external-link} page.

## Node Reference

The RSS Read node has only one property:

- *URL* field: This field is used to specify the web address of the RSS publication.

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to read an RSS Feed using the RSS Read node. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/583){:target=_blank .external-link} on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following two nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [RSS Read]()


The final workflow should look like the following image.

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

### 2. RSS Read node

1. Enter the URL of the RSS feed that you want to read in the *URL* field.
2. Click on *Execute Node* to run the workflow.
