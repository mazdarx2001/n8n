# Postgres trigger

Use the Postgres trigger node to respond to events in Postgres and integrate Postgres with other applications. n8n has built-in support responding to insert, update, and delete events

/// note | Credentials

/// note | Examples and templates
For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Postgres Trigger integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/postgres-trigger/){:target=_blank .external-link} page.

## Events

You can configure how the node listens for events.

* Select **Listen and Create Trigger Rule**, then choose the events to listen for:
	* Insert
	* Update
	* Delete
* Select **Listen to Channel**, then enter a channel name that the node should monitor.
