# Redis trigger

[Redis](https://redis.io/) is an open-source, in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker.

!!! note "Credentials"
    You can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/redis/).


Use the Redis trigger node to subscribe to a Redis channel. The workflow starts whenever the channel receives a new message.
