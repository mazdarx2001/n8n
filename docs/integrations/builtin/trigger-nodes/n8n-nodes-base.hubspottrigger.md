# HubSpot trigger

[HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} provides tools for social media marketing, content management, web analytics, landing pages, customer support, and search engine optimization.

!!! note "Credentials"
	You can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/hubspot/).

!!! note "Examples and templates"
	For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [HubSpot trigger](https://n8n.io/integrations/hubspot-trigger/){:target=_blank .external-link} page.

!!! warning "Webhooks"
    If you activate a second trigger, the previous trigger stops working. This is because the trigger registers a new webhook with HubSpot when activated. HubSpot only allows one webhook at a time.
