## Configure a webhook in TheHive

To configure the webhook for your TheHive instance:

1. Copy the webhook URL from TheHive Trigger node.
2. Add the following lines to the application.conf file. This is TheHive configuration file.
	```
	notification.webhook.endpoints = [
		{
			name: WEBHOOK_NAME
			url: WEBHOOK_URL
			version: 0
			wsConfig: {}
			includedTheHiveOrganisations: ["ORGANIZATION_NAME"]
			excludedTheHiveOrganisations: []
		}
	]
	```
3. Replace `WEBHOOK_URL` with the URL you copied in the previous step.
4. Replace `ORGANIZATION_NAME` with your organization name.
5. Execute the following cURL command to enable notifications:
	```sh
	curl -XPUT -uTHEHIVE_USERNAME:THEHIVE_PASSWORD -H 'Content-type: application/json' THEHIVE_URL/api/config/organisation/notification -d '
	{
		"value": [
			{
			"delegate": false,
			"trigger": { "name": "AnyEvent"},
			"notifier": { "name": "webhook", "endpoint": "WEBHOOK_NAME" }
			}
		]
	}'
	```
