## Node parameters

**Model**: the model to use to generate the completion. n8n dynamically loads models from Mistral Cloud and you will only see the models available to your account.

## Node options

* **Maximum Number of Tokens**: the completion length, in characters.
* **Sampling Temperature**: controls the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.
* **Timeout**: maximum request time in milliseconds.
* **Max Retries**: maximum number of times to retry a request.
* **Top P**: use a lower value to ignore less probable options. 
* **Enable Safe Mode**: enable safe mode by injecting a safety prompt at the beginning of the completion. This helps prevent the model from generating offensive content.
* **Random Seed**: seed to use for random sampling. If set, different calls will generate deterministic results.
