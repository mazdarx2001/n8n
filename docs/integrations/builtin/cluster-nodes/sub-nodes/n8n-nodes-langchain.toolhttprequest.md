# HTTP Request Tool

The HTTP Request tool works just like the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node but it allows you to use it with an AI agent as a tool to collect information from a website or API.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the HTTP Request node supports and links to more resources.

/// note | Credentials
Refer to [HTTP Request credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/httprequest/) for guidance on setting up authentication.
