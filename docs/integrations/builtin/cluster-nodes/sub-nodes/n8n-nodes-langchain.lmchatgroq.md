## Node parameters

* **Model**: The model which will generate the completion. Learn more in the [Groq model documentation](https://console.groq.com/docs/models){:target=_blank .external-link}. Available models are loaded dynamically from the Groq API.

## Node options

* **Maximum Number of Tokens**: the maximum number of tokens to generate in the completion.
* **Sampling Temperature**: controls randomness. Lowering the value results in less random completions. As the temperature approaches zero, the model will become deterministic and repetitive. Valid range is 0 to 1.
