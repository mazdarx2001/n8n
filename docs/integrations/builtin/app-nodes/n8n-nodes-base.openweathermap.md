# OpenWeatherMap

The OpenWeatherMap node allows you to automate work in OpenWeatherMap, and integrate OpenWeatherMap with other applications. n8n supports retrieving current and upcoming weather data with OpenWeatherMap.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the OpenWeatherMap node supports and links to more resources.

!!! note "Credentials"
    Refer to [OpenWeatherMap credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/openweathermap/) for guidance on setting up authentication. 

!!! note "Examples and templates"
    For usage examples and templates to help you get started, take a look at n8n's [OpenWeatherMap integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/openweathermap/){:target="_blank" .external-link} list.


## Basic Operations

* Returns the current weather data
* Returns the weather data for the next 5 days

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to get the current weather data for a city. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/460) on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following two nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [OpenWeatherMap]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Start node

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

### 2. OpenWeatherMap node

1. First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the OpenWeatherMap node. You can find out how to do that [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/openweathermap/).
2. Enter the name of the city in the *City* field.
3. Click on *Execute Node* to run the workflow.
