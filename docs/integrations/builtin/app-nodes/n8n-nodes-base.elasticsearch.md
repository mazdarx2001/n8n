# Elasticsearch

The Elasticsearch node allows you to automate work in Elasticsearch, and integrate Elasticsearch with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Elasticsearch features, including creating, updating, deleting, and getting documents and indexes. 

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Elasticsearch node supports and links to more resources.

!!! note "Credentials"
    Refer to [Elasticsearch credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/elasticsearch/) for guidance on setting up authentication. 

!!! note "Examples and templates"
    For usage examples and templates to help you get started, take a look at n8n's [Elasticsearch integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/elasticsearch/){:target="_blank" .external-link} list.


## Basic operations

* Document
    * Create a document
    * Delete a document
    * Get a document
    * Get all documents
    * Update a document
* Index
    * Create
    * Delete
    * Get
    * Get All

## Example usage

This workflow allows you to get all documents for a selected index. This example usage workflow uses the following nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Elasticsearch]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Start node

The Start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

### 2. Elasticsearch node

1. First enter credentials for the Elasticsearch node. You can find out how to do that [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/elasticsearch/).
