# Rundeck

The Rundeck node allows you to automate work in Rundeck, and integrate Rundeck with other applications. n8n has built-in support for executing jobs and getting metadata.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Rundeck node supports and links to more resources.

!!! note "Credentials"
    Refer to [Rundeck credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/rundeck/) for guidance on setting up authentication. 

!!! note "Examples and templates"
    For usage examples and templates to help you get started, take a look at n8n's [Rundeck integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/rundeck/){:target="_blank" .external-link} list.


## Basic Operations

**Job**
- Execute a job
- Get metadata of a job


## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to execute a job on Rundeck. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/539) on this website. This example usage workflow uses the following two nodes.

- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Rundeck]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

2. Enter your Rundeck job ID in the *Job Id* field. You can find instructions on how to obtain the job ID in the FAQs below.
3. Click on *Execute Node* to run the workflow.

## FAQs

### How do I find the Job ID?

1. Access your Rundeck dashboard.
2. Open the project that contains the job you want to use with n8n.
