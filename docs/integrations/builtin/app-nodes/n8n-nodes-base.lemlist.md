# Lemlist

The Lemlist node allows you to automate work in Lemlist, and integrate Lemlist with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Lemlist features, including getting activities, teams and campaigns, as well as creating, updating, and deleting leads. 

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Lemlist node supports and links to more resources.

!!! note "Credentials"
    Refer to [Lemlist credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/lemlist/) for guidance on setting up authentication. 

!!! note "Examples and templates"
    For usage examples and templates to help you get started, take a look at n8n's [Lemlist integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/lemlist/){:target="_blank" .external-link} list.

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to list emails from Airtable and create corresponding leads in Lemlist. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/983) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow uses the following nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Airtable]/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtable/)
- [Lemlist]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Start node

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

### 2. Airtable node (List)

This node will list all the records from Airtable. Create a table like [this](https://airtable.com/shruiCc4kttDVsTsD) in your Airtable base.

1. First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the Airtable node. You can find out how to do that [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/airtable/).
2. Select the 'List' option from the ***Operation*** dropdown list.
3. Enter the Base ID in the ***Base ID*** field. For obtaining the Base ID, head over to their [API page](https://airtable.com/api) and select the correct base. You'll find the Base ID there.
4. Enter the name of your table in the ***Table*** field.
5. Click on the gears icon next to the ***Table*** field and click on ***Add Expression***.
6. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.

In the screenshot below, you will notice that the node returns the information of the leads.

### 3. Lemlist node (create: lead)

This node will create new leads for a campaign in Lemlist.

1. First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the Lemlist node. You can find out how to do that [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/lemlist/).
2. Select 'Lead' from the ***Resource*** dropdown list.
3. Select a campaign from the ***Campaign ID*** dropdown list.
4. Click on the gears icon next to the ***Email*** field and click on ***Add Expression***.

5. Select the following in the ***Variable Selector*** section: Current Node > Input Data > JSON > fields > Email. You can also add the following expression: `{{$json["fields"]["Email"]}}`.
6. Click on the ***Add Field*** button and select 'First Name'.
7. Click on the gears icon next to the ***First Name*** field and click on ***Add Expression***.
8. Select the following in the ***Variable Selector*** section: Current Node > Input Data > JSON > fields > Name. You can also add the following expression: `{{$json["fields"]["Name"]}}`.
9. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.

In the screenshot below, you will notice that the node creates new leads in Lemlist.
