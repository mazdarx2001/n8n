# Marketstack

The Marketstack node allows you to automate work in Marketstack, and integrate Marketstack with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Marketstack features, including getting exchanges, end-of-day data, and tickers. 

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Marketstack node supports and links to more resources.

!!! note "Credentials"
    Refer to [Marketstack credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/marketstack/) for guidance on setting up authentication. 

!!! note "Examples and templates"
    For usage examples and templates to help you get started, take a look at n8n's [Marketstack integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/marketstack/){:target="_blank" .external-link} list.


## Basic operations

* End-of-Day Data
    * Get All
* Exchange
    * Get
* Ticker

## Example usage

This workflow allows you to get the past week's end of day data for a desired stock symbol. This example usage workflow uses the following two nodes.

- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Marketstack]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
