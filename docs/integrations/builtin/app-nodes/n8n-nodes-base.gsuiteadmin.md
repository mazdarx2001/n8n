## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to create, update, and get a user using the G Suite Admin node. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/710) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow uses the following nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [G Suite Admin]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Start node

The Start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

### 2. G Suite Admin node (create: user)

This node will create a user in G Suite with the following information:  first name, last name, password, domain, and username.

1. First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the G Suite Admin node. You can find out how to do that [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/).
3. Enter the first name of the user in the ***First Name*** field.
4. Enter the last name of the user in the ***Last Name*** field.
5. Enter a password for the user in the ***Password*** field.
6. Select the domain from the ***Domain*** dropdown list.
7. Enter the username for the user in the ***Username*** field.
8. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the workflow.

In the screenshot below, you will observe that the node has created a new user with the first name `Nathan`, last name `Nat`, domain `n8n.io`, username `nat`, and a password, in G Suite.
