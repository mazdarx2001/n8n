# Google Perspective

The Google Perspective node allows you to automate work in Google Perspective, and integrate Google Perspective with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Google Perspective features, including analyzing comments.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Google Perspective node supports and links to more resources.

!!! note "Credentials"
    Refer to [Google Perspective credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/) for guidance on setting up authentication. 

!!! note "Examples and templates"
    For usage examples and templates to help you get started, take a look at n8n's [Google Perspective integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/google-perspective/){:target="_blank" .external-link} list.

## Example usage

This workflow allows you to analyze a comment for profanity. This example usage workflow uses the following nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)

The final workflow should look like the following image.
