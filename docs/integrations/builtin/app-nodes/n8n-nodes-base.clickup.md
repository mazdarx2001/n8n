## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to create a task in ClickUp. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/485) on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following two nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [ClickUp]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
