# GitHub

The GitHub node allows you to automate work in GitHub, and integrate GitHub with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of GitHub features, including creating, updating, deleting, and editing files, repositories, issues, releases, and users. 

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the GitHub node supports and links to more resources.

!!! note "Credentials"

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to get the community profile of a GitHub repository. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/450) on the website. This example usage workflow uses the following two nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [GitHub]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
