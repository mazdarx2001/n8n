# Storyblok

The Storyblok node allows you to automate work in Storyblok, and integrate Storyblok with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Storyblok features, including getting, deleting, and publishing stories. 

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Storyblok node supports and links to more resources.

!!! note "Credentials"
    Refer to [Storyblok credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/storyblok/) for guidance on setting up authentication. 

!!! note "Examples and templates"
    For usage examples and templates to help you get started, take a look at n8n's [Storyblok integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/storyblok/){:target="_blank" .external-link} list.


## Basic Operations

### Content API

- Delete a story
- Get a story

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to get all the stories that have the slug starting with `release` and publish them using the Storyblok node. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/768) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow would use the following nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Storyblok]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
