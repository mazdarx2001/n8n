# Intercom

The Intercom node allows you to automate work in Intercom, and integrate Intercom with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Intercom features, including creating, updating, deleting, and getting companies, leads, and users. 

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Intercom node supports and links to more resources.

This workflow allows you to create a new user in Intercom. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/464) on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following two nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Intercom]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
