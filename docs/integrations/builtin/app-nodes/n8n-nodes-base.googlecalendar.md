# Google Calendar

The Google Calendar node allows you to automate work in Google Calendar, and integrate Google Calendar with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Google Calendar features, including adding, retrieving, deleting and updating calendar events.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Google Calendar node supports and links to more resources.

!!! note "Credentials"
    Refer to [Google Calendar credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/) for guidance on setting up authentication. 

!!! note "Examples and templates"
    For usage examples and templates to help you get started, take a look at n8n's [Google Calendar integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/google-calendar/){:target="_blank" .external-link} list.


## Basic Operations

* Calendar
    * If a time-slot is available in a calendar
* Event
    * Add a event to calendar
    * Delete an event
    * Retrieve an event
    * Retrieve all events from a calendar
    * Update an event

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to add an event to Google Calendar. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/427) on the website. This example usage workflow uses the following two nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Google Calendar]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.
