# MailerLite

The MailerLite node allows you to automate work in MailerLite, and integrate MailerLite with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of MailerLite features, including creating, updating, deleting, and getting subscribers.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the MailerLite node supports and links to more resources.

!!! note "Credentials"
    Refer to [MailerLite credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/mailerlite/) for guidance on setting up authentication. 

!!! note "Examples and templates"
    For usage examples and templates to help you get started, take a look at n8n's [MailerLite integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/mailerlite/){:target="_blank" .external-link} list.


## Basic Operations

* Subscriber
    * Create a new subscriber
    * Get an subscriber
    * Get all subscribers

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to create, update, and get a subscriber using the MailerLite node. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/751) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow uses the following nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [MailerLite]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Start node

The Start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

### 2. MailerLite node (create: subscriber)

This node will create a new subscriber in MailerLite. We will add the name of the subscriber along with their email.
