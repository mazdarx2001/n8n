# Pipedrive

The Pipedrive node allows you to automate work in Pipedrive, and integrate Pipedrive with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Pipedrive features, including creating, updating, deleting, and getting activity, files, notes, organizations, and leads. 

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Pipedrive node supports and links to more resources.

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to create an deal in Pipedrive. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/489) on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following two nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Pipedrive]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

![A workflow with the Pipedrive node](/_images/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/pipedrive/workflow.png)

### 1. Start node

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

### 2. Pipedrive node

1. First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the Pipedrive node. You can find out how to do that [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/pipedrive/).
2. Enter the title of the deal in the *Title* field.
3. Click on *Execute Node* to run the workflow.
