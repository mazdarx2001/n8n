# Freshdesk

The Freshdesk node allows you to automate work in Freshdesk and integrate Freshdesk with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Freshdesk features, including creating, updating, deleting, and getting contacts and tickets.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Freshdesk node supports and links to more resources.

!!! note "Credentials"
    Refer to [Freshdesk credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/freshdesk/) for guidance on setting up authentication.

- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
