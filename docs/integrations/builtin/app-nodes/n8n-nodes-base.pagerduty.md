# PagerDuty

The PagerDuty node allows you to automate work in PagerDuty, and integrate PagerDuty with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of PagerDuty features, including creating incident notes, as well as updating, and getting all log entries and users. 

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the PagerDuty node supports and links to more resources.

!!! note "Credentials"
    Refer to [PagerDuty credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/pagerduty/) for guidance on setting up authentication.

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to create, update, and get an incident on PagerDuty. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/411) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow would use the following nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [PagerDuty]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
