# Google Contacts

The Google Contacts node allows you to automate work in Google Contacts, and integrate Google Contacts with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Google Contacts features, including creating, updating, retrieving, deleting, and getting contacts. 

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Google Contacts node supports and links to more resources.

!!! note "Credentials"
