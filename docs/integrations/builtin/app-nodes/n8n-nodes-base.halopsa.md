- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [HaloPSA]()

### 1. Start node

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

### 2. HaloPSA node (resource: client)

This node will create a new client in HaloPSA.

1. First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the HaloPSA node. You can find out how to do that [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/halopsa/).
2. Select 'Client' in the ***Resource*** field.
3. Select 'Create' in the ***Operation*** field.
4. Enter the client name in the ***Name*** field.
5. Add additional fields such as ***VIP*** or ***Website*** by clicking ***Add Field***.

In the below screenshot you can see how the node creates a new client in HaloPSA.
