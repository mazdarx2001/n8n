# UpLead

The UpLead node allows you to automate work in UpLead, and integrate UpLead with other applications. n8n supports several UpLead operations, including getting company information. 

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the UpLead node supports and links to more resources.

!!! note "Credentials"
    Refer to [UpLead credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/uplead/) for guidance on setting up authentication. 

!!! note "Examples and templates"
    For usage examples and templates to help you get started, take a look at n8n's [UpLead integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/uplead/){:target="_blank" .external-link} list.


## Basic Operations

* Company
    * Enrich
* Person
    * Enrich

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to get information about a company with UpLead. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/504) on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following two nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [UpLead]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Start node

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

### 2. UpLead node

1. First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the UpLead node. You can find out how to do that [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/uplead/).
2. Enter the name of the company in the *Company* field. For example, I entered `Apple`.
3. Click on *Execute Node* to run the workflow.
