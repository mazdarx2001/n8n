# Bannerbear

The Bannerbear node allows you to automate work in Bannerbear, and integrate Bannerbear with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Bannerbear features, including creating and getting images and templates.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Bannerbear node supports and links to more resources.

!!! note "Credentials"
    Refer to [Bannerbear credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/bannerbear/) for guidance on setting up authentication. 

!!! note "Examples and Templates"
    For usage examples and templates to help you get started, take a look at n8n's [Bannerbear integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/bannerbear/){:target=_blank .external-link} list.

This workflow allows you to create an image using the Bannerbear welcome template. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/544) on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following two nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)

The final workflow should look like the following image.
