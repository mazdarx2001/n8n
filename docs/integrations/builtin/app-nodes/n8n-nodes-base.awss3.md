# AWS S3

The AWS S3 node allows you to automate work in AWS S3, and integrate AWS S3 with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of AWS S3 features, including creating and deleting buckets, copying and downloading files, as well as getting folders.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the AWS S3 node supports and links to more resources.

!!! note "Credentials"
    Refer to [AWS credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/aws/) for guidance on setting up authentication. 


!!! note "Examples and Templates"
    For usage examples and templates to help you get started, take a look at n8n's [AWS S3 integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/aws-s3/){:target=_blank .external-link} list.

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to create a bucket on AWS S3. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/458) on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following two nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [AWS S3]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Start node

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.
