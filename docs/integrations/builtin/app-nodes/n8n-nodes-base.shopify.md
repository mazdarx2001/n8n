# Shopify

The Shopify node allows you to automate work in Shopify, and integrate Shopify with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Shopify features, including creating, updating, deleting, and getting orders and products. 

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Shopify node supports and links to more resources.

!!! note "Credentials"
    Refer to [Shopify credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/shopify/) for guidance on setting up authentication. 

!!! note "Examples and templates"
    For usage examples and templates to help you get started, take a look at n8n's [Shopify integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/shopify/){:target="_blank" .external-link} list.

- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
