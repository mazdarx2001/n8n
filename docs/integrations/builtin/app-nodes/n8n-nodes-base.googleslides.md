# Google Slides

The Google Slides node allows you to automate work in Google Slides, and integrate Google Slides with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Google Slides features, including creating presentations, and getting pages. 

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Google Slides node supports and links to more resources.

!!! note "Credentials"

!!! note "Examples and templates"
    For usage examples and templates to help you get started, take a look at n8n's [Google Slides integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/google-slides/){:target="_blank" .external-link} list.


## Basic Operations

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to get all the slides from a presentation and get the thumbnails for the pages. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1035) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow uses the following nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Google Slides]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Start node

The Start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

### 2. Google Slides node (getSlides: presentation)

#### Get Presentation ID

1. Open a Google Slides presentation.
2. Copy the string of characters located between `/d/` and `/edit` in your presentation URL. This string is the Presentation ID, which we will use in the Google Slides node.

#### Configure the Google Slides node

This Google Slides node will get all the slides from a presentation.

1. Select 'OAuth2' from the ***Authentication*** dropdown list.
2.  First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the Google Slides node. You can find out how to enter credentials for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/).
3. Select 'Get Slides' from the ***Operation*** dropdown list.
4. Paste the Presentation ID you copied in the previous step, in the ***Presentation ID*** field.
5. Toggle ***Return All*** to `true`.
6. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the workflow.

In the screenshot below, you will notice that the node returns all the slides from the presentation.
