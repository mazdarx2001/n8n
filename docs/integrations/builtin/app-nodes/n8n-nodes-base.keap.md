The Keap node allows you to automate work in Keap, and integrate Keap with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Keap features, including creating, updating, deleting, and getting companies, products, ecommerce orders, emails, and files. 

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Keap node supports and links to more resources.

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to get all contacts from Keap. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/553) on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following two nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Keap]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

![A workflow with the Keap node](/_images/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/keap/workflow.png)

### 1. Start node

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

### 2. Keap node

2. Select the 'Contact' option from the *Resource* dropdown list.
3. Select the 'Get All' option from the *Operation* dropdown list.
4. Click on *Execute Node* to run the workflow.
