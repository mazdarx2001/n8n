# NocoDB

The NocoDB node allows you to automate work in NocoDB, and integrate NocoDB with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of NocoDB features, including creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving rows. 

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the NocoDB node supports and links to more resources.

!!! note "Credentials"
    Refer to [NocoDB credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/nocodb/) for guidance on setting up authentication. 

!!! note "Examples and templates"
    For usage examples and templates to help you get started, take a look at n8n's [NocoDB integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/nocodb/){:target="_blank" .external-link} list.
