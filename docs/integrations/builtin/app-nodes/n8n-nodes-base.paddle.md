# Paddle

The Paddle node allows you to automate work in Paddle, and integrate Paddle with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Paddle features, including creating, updating, and getting coupons, as well as getting plans, products, and users. 

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Paddle node supports and links to more resources.

!!! note "Credentials"
    Refer to [Paddle credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/paddle/) for guidance on setting up authentication. 

!!! note "Examples and templates"
    For usage examples and templates to help you get started, take a look at n8n's [Paddle integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/paddle/){:target="_blank" .external-link} list.

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to create a coupon on Paddle. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/659) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow would use the following nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Paddle]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.
