# Microsoft Excel

The Microsoft Excel node allows you to automate work in Microsoft Excel, and integrate Microsoft Excel with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Microsoft Excel features, including adding and retrieving lists of table data, and workbooks, as well as getting worksheets. 

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Microsoft Excel node supports and links to more resources.

!!! note "Credentials"
    Refer to [Microsoft Excel credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/microsoft/) for guidance on setting up authentication. 

!!! note "Examples and templates"
    For usage examples and templates to help you get started, take a look at n8n's [Microsoft Excel integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/microsoft-excel/){:target="_blank" .external-link} list.

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to get information about all workbooks from Microsoft Excel. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/566) on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following two nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Microsoft Excel]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
