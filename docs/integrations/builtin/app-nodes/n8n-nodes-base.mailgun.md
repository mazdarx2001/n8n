# Mailgun

The Mailgun node allows you to automate work in Mailgun, and integrate Mailgun with other applications. n8n has built-in support for sending emails with Mailgun. 

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Mailgun node supports and links to more resources.

!!! note "Credentials"
    Refer to [Mailgun credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/mailgun/) for guidance on setting up authentication. 

!!! note "Examples and templates"
    For usage examples and templates to help you get started, take a look at n8n's [Mailgun integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/mailgun/){:target="_blank" .external-link} list.


## Basic Operations

- Send an email

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to send an email using Mailgun. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/522) on this website. This example usage workflow uses the following two nodes.

- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Mailgun]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
