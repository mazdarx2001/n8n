# Mandrill

The Mandrill node allows you to automate work in Mandrill, and integrate Mandrill with other applications. n8n supports sending messages based on templates or HTML with Mandrill.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Mandrill node supports and links to more resources.

!!! note "Credentials"
    Refer to [Mandrill credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/mandrill/) for guidance on setting up authentication. 

!!! note "Examples and templates"
    For usage examples and templates to help you get started, take a look at n8n's [Mandrill integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/mandrill/){:target="_blank" .external-link} list.


## Basic Operations

* Message
    * Send message based on template.
    * Send message based on HTML.

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to send an email using a template via Mandrill. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/571) on this website. This example usage workflow uses the following two nodes.

- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Mandrill]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
