# MySQL

The MySQL node allows you to automate work in MySQL, and integrate MySQL with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of MySQL features, including executing an SQL query, as well as inserting, and updating rows in a database.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the MySQL node supports and links to more resources.

!!! note "Credentials"
    Refer to [MySQL credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/mysql/) for guidance on setting up authentication. 

!!! note "Examples and templates"
    For usage examples and templates to help you get started, take a look at n8n's [MySQL integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/mysql/){:target="_blank" .external-link} list.



## Basic Operations

* Execute an SQL query.
* Insert rows in database.
* Update rows in database

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to create a table and insert data in it on a MySQL database. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/598) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow would use the following nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Set](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/)
- [MySQL]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Start node

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

### 2. MySQL node (Execute Query)

1. First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the MySQL node. You can find out how to do that [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/mysql/).
2. Select 'Execute Query' from the ***Operation*** dropdown list.
3. Enter the following SQL query in the ***Query*** field: `CREATE TABLE test (id INT, name VARCHAR(255), PRIMARY KEY (id));`.
4. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.

### 3. Set node

1. Set the ***Keep Only Set*** toggle to true.
2. Click on the ***Add Value*** button and select 'Number' from the dropdown list.
3. Enter `id` in the ***Name*** field.
4. Click on the ***Add Value*** button and select 'String' from the dropdown list.
5. Enter `name` in the ***Name*** field.
6. Enter the value for the name in the ***Value*** field.
7. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.

### 4. MySQL1 node (Insert)

1. Select the credentials that you entered in the previous MySQL node.
2. Enter `test` in the ***Table*** field.
3. Enter `id, name` in the ***Columns*** field.
4. Click on ***Execute Node*** to run the node.
