# AWS SES

The AWS SES node allows you to automate work in AWS SES, and integrate AWS SES with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of AWS SES features, including creating, getting, deleting, sending, updating, and adding templates and emails.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the AWS SES node supports and links to more resources.

!!! note "Credentials"
    Refer to [AWS SES credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/aws/) for guidance on setting up authentication.

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to send an email using AWS SES. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/507) on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following two nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [AWS SES]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
