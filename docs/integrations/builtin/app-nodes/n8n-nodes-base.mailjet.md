# Mailjet

The Mailjet node allows you to automate work in Mailjet, and integrate Mailjet with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Mailjet features, including sending emails, and sms. 

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Mailjet node supports and links to more resources.

!!! note "Credentials"
    Refer to [Mailjet credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/mailjet/) for guidance on setting up authentication. 

!!! note "Examples and templates"
    For usage examples and templates to help you get started, take a look at n8n's [Mailjet integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/mailjet/){:target="_blank" .external-link} list.

This workflow allows you to send an email using Mailjet. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/520) on this website. This example usage workflow uses the following two nodes.

- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Mailjet]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
