# GitLab

The GitLab node allows you to automate work in GitLab, and integrate GitLab with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of GitLab features, including creating, updating, deleting, and editing issues, repositories, releases and users. 

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the GitLab node supports and links to more resources.

!!! note "Credentials"
    Refer to [GitLab credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/gitlab/) for guidance on setting up authentication. 

!!! note "Examples and templates"
    For usage examples and templates to help you get started, take a look at n8n's [GitLab integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/gitlab/){:target="_blank" .external-link} list.

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to get the details of a GitLab repository. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/465) on the website. This example usage workflow uses the following two nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [GitLab]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
