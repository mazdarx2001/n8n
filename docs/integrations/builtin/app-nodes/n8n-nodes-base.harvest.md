# Harvest

The Harvest node allows you to automate work in Harvest, and integrate Harvest with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Harvest features, including creating, updating, deleting, and getting clients, contacts, invoices, tasks, expenses, users, and projects. 

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Harvest node supports and links to more resources.

!!! note "Credentials"
    Refer to [Harvest credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/harvest/) for guidance on setting up authentication. 

!!! note "Examples and templates"

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to create a client in Harvest. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/494) on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following two nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Harvest]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

![A workflow with the Harvest node](/_images/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/harvest/workflow.png)

### 1. Start node

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

### 2. Harvest node

1. First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the Harvest node. You can find out how to do that [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/harvest/).
2. Select the 'Client' option from the *Resource* dropdown list.
3. Select the 'Create' option from the *Operation* dropdown list.
4. Enter the name of the client in the *Name* field.
5. Click on *Execute Node* to run the workflow.
