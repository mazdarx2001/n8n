# Jenkins

The Jenkins node allows you to automate work in Jenkins, and integrate Jenkins with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Jenkins features, including listing builds, managing instances, and creating and copying jobs. 

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Jenkins node supports and links to more resources.

!!! note "Credentials"
    Refer to [Jenkins credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/jenkins/) for guidance on setting up authentication. 

!!! note "Examples and templates"
    For usage examples and templates to help you get started, take a look at n8n's [Jenkins integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/jenkins/){:target="_blank" .external-link} list.


## Basic Operations

* Build
    * List Builds
* Instance
    * Cancel quiet down state
    * Put Jenkins in quiet mode, no builds can be started, Jenkins is ready for shutdown
    * Restart Jenkins immediately on environments where it is possible
    * Restart Jenkins once no jobs are running on environments where it is possible
    * Shutdown once no jobs are running
    * Shutdown Jenkins immediately
* Job
    * Copy a specific job
    * Create a new job
    * Trigger a specific job
    * Trigger a specific job

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to get list of builds in Jenkins. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/454) on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following two nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Jenkins]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.

### 1. Start node

The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow.

### 2. CircleCI node

1. First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the Jenkins node. You can find out how to do that [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/jenkins/).
2. Select the *Build*  from the dropdown in the *Resources* field.
3. *Get All Builds* is not selected in *Operations* dropdown.
4. Adjust the *depth* or add optional parameter by clickin *Add Field* button
5. Click on *Execute Node* to run the workflow.
