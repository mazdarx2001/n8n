# LinkedIn

The LinkedIn node allows you to automate work in LinkedIn, and integrate LinkedIn with other applications. n8n supports creating posts.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the LinkedIn node supports and links to more resources.

!!! note "Credentials"
    Refer to [LinkedIn credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/linkedIn/) for guidance on setting up authentication. 

!!! note "Examples and templates"
    For usage examples and templates to help you get started, take a look at n8n's [LinkedIn integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/linkedin/){:target="_blank" .external-link} list.


## Basic Operations

* Post
    * Create a new post

!!! note "Keep in mind"
    If posting as an Organization enter only the organization number in the URN field. For example, `03262013` not `urn:li:company:03262013`.


## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to get an image from a URL and post it on LinkedIn. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/681) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow would use the following nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/)
- [LinkedIn]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
