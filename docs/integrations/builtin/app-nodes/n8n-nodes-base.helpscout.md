# Help Scout


The Help Scout node allows you to automate work in Help Scout, and integrate Help Scout with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Help Scout features, including creating, updating, deleting, and getting conversations, and customers.


On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Help Scout node supports and links to more resources.

!!! note "Credentials"
    Refer to [Help Scout credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/helpscout/) for guidance on setting up authentication. 

!!! note "Examples and templates"
    For usage examples and templates to help you get started, take a look at n8n's [Help Scout integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/helpscout/){:target="_blank" .external-link} list.

This workflow allows you to get all mailboxes from Help Scout. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/567) on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following two nodes.
- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Help Scout]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
