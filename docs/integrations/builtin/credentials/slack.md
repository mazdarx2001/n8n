## Prerequisites

- OAuth2

## Related resources

Refer to [Slack's API documentation](https://api.slack.com/apis){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using API access token

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An **Access Token**

To generate an access token, create a Slack app:

1. Open your [Slack API Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps){:target=_blank .external-link} page.
2. Select **Create New App > From scratch**.
3. Enter an **App Name**.
4. Select the **Workspace** where you'll be developing your app.
5. Select **Create App**.
6. In **Basic Information > Building Apps for Slack**, select **Add features and functionality**.
7. Select **Permissions**.
8. In the **Scopes** section:
    * If you want your app to act on behalf of users who authorize the app, add the required scopes under the **User Token Scopes** section.
    * If you're building a bot, add the required scopes under the **Bot Token Scopes** section. 
    
    /// note | Scopes
    Scopes determine what permissions an app has. Refer to Slack's [Permission scopes](https://api.slack.com/scopes){:target=_blank .external-link} documentation for a list of scopes.
    ///
    
8. After you've added scopes, go up to the **OAuth Tokens for Your Workspace** section and select **Install to Workspace**. You must be a Slack workspace admin to complete this action.
9. Select **Allow**.
10. You'll return to the **OAuth Tokens for your Workspace** section, which now displays a **Bot User OAuth Token**.
