# IMAP credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [IMAP Email](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.emailimap/)

## Prerequisites

Create an email account on a service with IMAP support.

## Supported authentication methods

- User account

## Related resources

Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is a standard protocol for receiving email. Most email providers offer instructions on setting up their service with IMAP; refer to your provider's IMAP instructions.

## Using user account

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **User** name: The email address you're retrieving email for
- A **Password**: Either the password you use to check email or an app password. Your provider will tell you whether to use your own password or to generate an app password.
- A **Host**: The IMAP host address for your email provider, generally formatted as `imap.<provider>.com`. Check with your provider.
- A **Port** number: The default is port 993. Use this port unless your provider or email administrator tells you to use something different.

You can choose whether to use **SSL/TLS** and whether to **Allow Self-Signed Certificates**.

See below for more detailed instructions on some common email providers.

## Using Gmail

To configure the IMAP credential with a Gmail account, use these settings:

- **User**: Enter your Gmail email address.
- **Password**: Generate an **App password** and use that password in the n8n credential. Refer to Google's [Sign in with app passwords documentation](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en){:target=_blank .external-link} for detailed instructions.
- **Host**: Enter `imap.gmail.com`.
- **Port**: Keep the default Port number or check with your email administrator.
- **SSL/TLS**: Toggle on.
- **Allow Self-Signed Certificates**: Should work with either setting.

Refer to [Add Gmail to another client](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7126229?hl=en){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information. You may need to **Enable IMAP** if you're using a personal Google account before June 2024.

## Using Yahoo Mail

To configure the IMAP credential with a Yahoo Mail account, use these settings:

- **User**: Enter your Yahoo email address.
- **Password**: Generate an **App password** and use that password in the n8n credential. Refer to Yahoo's [Generate and manage 3rd-party app passwords](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/generate-manage-third-party-passwords-sln15241.html){:target=_blank .external-link} for detailed instructions.
- **Host**: Enter `imap.mail.yahoo.com`.
- **Port**: Keep the default Port number or check with your email administrator.
- **SSL/TLS**: Toggle on.

## Using Outlook.com

To configure the IMAP credential with Outlook.com account, use these settings:
