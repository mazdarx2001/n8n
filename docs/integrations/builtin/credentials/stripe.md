# Stripe credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Stripe Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stripetrigger/)
- [Stripe](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stripe/)

## Prerequisites

Create a [Stripe](https://stripe.com/){:target=_blank .external-link} account.

You must have either an admin or developer account.

## Supported authentication methods

- API key

## Related resources

Refer to [Stripe's API documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/api){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about the service.

## Using API key

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An API **Secret Key**: Choose whether to generate an API key in live mode or test mode. Refer to [Test mode and live mode](#test-mode-and-live-mode) for more information about the two modes.
    - For live mode: Go to your [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys){:target=_blank .external-link} to generate a Secret Key. 
    - For test mode: Go to your [Stripe test mode dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys){:target=_blank .external-link} to generate a Secret Key.
    - Be sure you create a **Secret Key** and not a **Publishable Key**.

Refer to [Create a secret API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#create-api-secret-key){:target=_blank .external-link} for more detailed instructions.

## Test mode and live mode

All Stripe API requests happen within either [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode) or live mode. Each mode has its own API key. 

Use test mode to access test data and live mode to access actual account data. Objects in one mode arenâ€™t accessible to the other.

Refer to [API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information about what's available in each mode and guidance on when to use which format.

/// note | n8n credentials for both modes
If you want to work with both live mode and test mode keys, store each mode's key in a separate n8n credential.
