If you need to configure OAuth2 from scratch or need more detail on what's happening in the OAuth web flow, refer to the instructions in the [Asana OAuth register an application documentation](https://developers.asana.com/docs/oauth#register-an-application){:target=_blank .external-link} to create an app and set up OAuth.

Use the following adjustments:

1. Use the n8n **OAuth Callback URL** as the Asana **Redirect URLs**.
2. Use the Asana **Client ID** and **Client secret** in the corresponding fields within n8n.

## Using API access token

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A Personal **Access Token** (PAT): Refer to the [Asana Quick start guide](https://developers.asana.com/docs/quick-start#setup){:target=_blank .external-link} for the steps to generate a Personal Access Token (PAT).
