# OpenAI credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes with the [OpenAI node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.openai/)


You need an OpenAI account. OpenAI uses API keys. Refer to their [Authentication documentation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication){:target=_blank .external-link} for guidance on getting your API key.

Once you have your key, copy it into **API Key** in the credentials modal in n8n.
