Refer to the [API Quickstart Account Setup documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/account-setup){:target=_blank .external-link} for more information.
- An **Organization ID**: Required if you belong to multiple organizations; otherwise, leave this blank.
    - Go to your [Organization Settings](https://platform.openai.com/account/organization) page to get your Organization ID. Refer to [Setting up your organization](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/production-best-practices/setting-up-your-organization) for more information.
    - API requests made using an Organization ID will count toward the organization's subscription quota.
