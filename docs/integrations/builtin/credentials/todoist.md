To configure this credential from scratch, you'll need:

- A **Client ID**

Get both by creating an application in the Todoist [App Management Console](https://developer.todoist.com/appconsole.html){:target=_blank .external-link}.

Use these settings for your application:

- Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from Todoist and add it to n8n.
