You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [npm](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.npm/)

## Prerequisites

* An npm account
* An Access Token. Follow [npm's documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-viewing-access-tokens){:target=_blank .external-link} to get your token.

## Using Access Token

1. Copy the Access token from npm into **Access Token**.
2. If you are using a custom npm registry set the **Registry Url**.
3. Select **Save**. n8n tests your credentials and confirms that they work.
