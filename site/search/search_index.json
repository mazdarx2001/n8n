What is Doc\u00b2? # DOC\u00b2 is the latest software and solution for document capture that was developed by Fellow Consulting AG. It is a completely cloud-based solution that uses Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to precisely identify, classify, analyze and read your documents. No matter if paper or file. DOC\u00b2 learns independently, the level of experience increases with each document. DOC\u00b2 uses swarm intelligence for this. The Advantages of DOC\u00b2 at a glance: Recognizes the required data \u2013 even handwritten information and information in tables reliably and is self-learning, even through corrections by the user With swarm intelligence, you benefit continuously from the experiences of other customers Improves the accuracy and quality of the recognized data Enables an automated process without ongoing corrections and interventions Simple intuitive interface No IT resources / specialists required Ensures a robust and consistent work process No sensitive data is stored or shared Saves time in the digital inbox Reduces errors caused by manual processing How do you use DOC\u00b2: # Scanning and Recognition of all types of documents (Invoices, Contracts, Forms, Medical Prescriptions etc.) Reliable extraction of the data in the document and integration and further processing in the ERP, RPA or CRM system) Validation of the extracted data and verification against other systems from internal and public sources Integration into your system landscape (e.g. ERP System, Document Management, Workflow System etc) Why DOC\u00b2 is just right for you # Many companies have recognized that processing incoming invoices, for example, can be very time-consuming. They are trying to increase productivity and optimize the purchase-to-pay process by introducing products for the \u201cdigitization\u201d of invoices. In addition, DOC\u00b2 uses swarm intelligence. What does that mean? You benefit from the experiences of other customers and their \u201clearning curve\u201d without sharing sensitive data. With the cloud-based rule engine, we ensure continuous improvement of the application. You don\u2019t need any developers or data scientists, because the system learns from the input of the user and the process runs without interruptions. With the help of deep learning algorithms, not only simple header data of a document can be recorded, but also complicated structures such as tables. Of course, not only invoices are processed, but all types of documents.

Here we use a folder n8n located on the /Desktop . Container Path : Provide the path of that directory where it will be accessible from inside the Docker container. Here we use /n8n . Click Run to start your n8n container. You can now access n8n by navigating your browser to localhost:5678 . Build your first workflow # For your first workflow, let's build something to take one tedious task off you plate: cleaning up a cluttered Gmail inbox. Keep in mind You can find this complete workflow here courtesy of n8n's own Tephlon . Open the Nodes Panel by click the orange + sign, then search and find the Gmail node . Click on it to add it to your canvas: When you add the Gmail node to the canvas, its configuration modal opens automatically: The first thing you need to do is configure your credentials so that n8n can communicate with your Gmail account. You'll notice that the OAuth2 method is selected by default for Authentication , so click the Credentials dropdown and select Create New . The new credentials modal appears: Copy the OAuth Callback URL from this modal, then open a new browser tab and navigate to your Google Cloud Console dashboard. From your Google Cloud Console, perform the following: Navigate to APIs & Services > Credentials . Click + CREATE CREDENTIALS and select OAuth client ID . Select Web Application from the Application type dropdown. Click +Add URI and enter the OAuth Callback URL you copied from n8n. Click Create to save your new credentials. A corresponding Client ID and Client Secret are now available. Copy these to use in n8n. Navigate to APIs & Services > Library , search for Gmail and select Enable . Keep in mind We go through a quick credential flow for Google in this example, but you can learn all about n8n credentials for Google services here . Return to your n8n tab and in the new credentials modal enter the Client ID and Client Secret obtained from your Google Cloud Console. A Sign in with Google button appears. Click the Sign in with Google button. A modal appears asking you to select your Google account and Allow access. Click Save to complete your Gmail credentials setup. Configure your Gmail node as follows: Resource : Select Message as we will be looking through all messages to decide which we can clean up. Operation : Select Get All since we want to fetch all messages, not any particular one. Return All : Leave this enabled so that the node fetches all you messages, no matter how full your inbox is. Add Field > Format : Select IDs so that we fetch only the message ID instead of its entire contents. Add Field > Query : This is where we use Gmail Search Operators to find the messages we want to delete. Here we use -in:chats unsubscribe to identify all messages not in chats that contain the word \"unsubscribe\". Next, let's add a Split in Batches node after the Gmail node. This will break up the cleanup operation into chucks so avoid hitting any API rate limits. Let's configure it to use batches of 100 messages at a time: Now let's add another Gmail node to perform the delete operation: Resource : Select Message as we will be deleting any message passed to this node. Operation : Select Delete . Message ID : Use the gears button to enter an expression . This enables the ID of each message from the first Gmail node to be dynamically passed to this node. From the Edit Expression window, use the menu to find and select the message ID in the Output Data : Lastly, let's ensure your nodes are properly connected in the workflow. The final result should look like this: You've build your fist automation workflow and cleaned up a cluttered inbox in the process. Don't forget you can edit the query to find more messages to cleanup, and also set this workflow to run automatically using the Cron node . What's next? # Do you enjoy automating workflows?

For full details of how to use JMESPath, refer to the JMESPath documentation . The $jmespath() method # n8n provides a custom method, $jmespath() , for use in expressions. It allows you to perform a search on a JSON object using the JMESPath query language. The basic syntax is: 1 $jmespath ( object , searchString ) To help understand what the method does, here is the equivalent JavaScript. Note that you must use the custom method, not the JavaScript approach, because expressions must be single-line: 1 2 var jmespath = require ( 'jmespath' ); jmespath . search ( object , searchString ); object is a JSON object, such as the output of a previous node. searchString is an expression written in the JMESPath query language. The JMESPath Specification provides a list of supported expressions, while their Tutorial and Examples provide interactive examples. Search parameter order The examples in the JMESPath Specification follow the pattern search(searchString, object) . The JMESPath JavaScript library , which n8n uses, supports search(object, searchString) instead. This means that when using examples from the JMESPath documentation, you may need to change the order of the search function parameters. Common tasks # This section provides examples for some common operations. Many more examples, and detailed guidance, are available in JMESPath's own documentation . A shorter way to write basic operations # JMESPath provides a shorter and more readable way to write basic JSON queries. Consider the following scenario: you have a webhook trigger that receives data through the webhook body. You want to extract some of that data for use in the workflow. Your webhook data looks similar to this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 [ { \"headers\" : { \"host\" : \"n8n.instance.address\" , ... }, \"params\" : {}, \"query\" : {}, \"body\" : { \"name\" : \"Jim\" , \"age\" : 30 , \"city\" : \"New York\" , \"dogs\" : [ \"Fido\" , \"Spot\" ] } } ] Extract the city: 1 2 3 4 // With JMESPath {{ $json . body . city }} // Without JMESPath {{ $json [ 'body' ][ 'city' ]}} Get the first dog in dogs[] : 1 2 3 4 // With JMESPath {{ $json . body . dogs [ 0 ]}} // Without JMESPath {{ $json [ 'body' ][ 'dogs' ][ 0 ]}} Apply a JMESPath expression to a collection of elements with projections # From the JMESPath projections documentation : Projections are one of the key features of JMESPath. It allows you to apply an expression to a collection of elements. There are five kinds of projections: List Projections Slice Projections Object Projections Flatten Projections Filter Projections The following example shows basic usage of list, slice, and object projections.

The basic syntax is: 1 $jmespath ( object , searchString ) To help understand what the method does, here is the equivalent JavaScript. Note that you must use the custom method, not the JavaScript approach, because expressions must be single-line: 1 2 var jmespath = require ( 'jmespath' ); jmespath . search ( object , searchString ); object is a JSON object, such as the output of a previous node. searchString is an expression written in the JMESPath query language. The JMESPath Specification provides a list of supported expressions, while their Tutorial and Examples provide interactive examples. Search parameter order The examples in the JMESPath Specification follow the pattern search(searchString, object) .

For full details of how to use Luxon, refer to Luxon's documentation . Variables # n8n uses Luxon to provide two custom variables: $now : a Luxon object containing the current timestamp. Equivalent to DateTime.now() . $today : a Luxon object containing the current timestamp, rounded down to the day. Equivalent to DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 }) . Note that these variables can return different time formats when cast as a string. This is the same behavior as Luxon's DateTime.now() . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 {{ $now }} // Returns [Object: \"<ISO formatted timestamp>\"] // For example [Object: \"2022-03-09T14:00:25.058+00:00\"] {{ $now . toString ()}} // Returns the ISO formatted timestamp // For example 2022-03-09T14:02:37.065+00:00 {{ \"Today's date is \" + $now }} // Returns \"Today's date is <unix timestamp>\" // For example \"Today's date is 1646834498755\" Setting the timezone in n8n # Luxon uses the n8n timezone. This value is either: Default: America/New York A custom timezone for your n8n instance, set using the GENERIC_TIMEZONE environment variable. A custome timezone for an individual workflow, configured in workflow settings. Common tasks # This section provides examples for some common operations. Many more examples, and detailed guidance, are available in Luxon's own documentation . Get n days from today # Get a number of days before or after today. For example, you want to set a field to always show the date seven days before the current date. In the expressions editor, enter: 1 {{ $today . minus ({ days : 7 })}} On the 23rd June 2019, this returns [Object: \"2019-06-16T00:00:00.000+00:00\"] . This example uses n8n's custom variable $today for convenience. It is the equivalent of DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 }).minus({days: 7}) . For more detailed information and examples, refer to: Luxon's guide to math Their API documentation on DateTime plus and DateTime minus Create human-readable dates # In Get n days from today , the example gets the date seven days before the current date, and returns it as [Object: \"yyyy-mm-dd-T00:00:00.000+00:00\"] . To make this more readable, you can use Luxon's formatting functions. For example, you want the field containing the date to be formatted as DD/MM/YYYY. This expression gets the date seven days before today, and converts it to the DD/MM/YYYY format. So on the 23rd June 2019, it returns 23/06/2019: 1 {{ $today . minus ({ days : 7 }). toLocaleString ()}} You can alter the format. For example: 1 {{ $today . minus ({ days : 7 }). toLocaleString ({ month : 'long' , day : 'numeric' , year : 'numeric' })}} On 23rd June 2019, this returns \"16 June 2019\". Refer to Luxon's guide on toLocaleString (strings for humans) for more information. Convert date string to Luxon # You can convert date strings and other date formats to a Luxon DateTime object. You can convert from standard formats and from arbitrary strings. If you have a date in a supported standard technical format: Luxon provides functions to handle the conversion. Refer to Luxon's guide to Parsing technical formats for details. If you have a date as a string that does not use a standard format: Use Luxon's Ad-hoc parsing . To do this, use the fromFormat() function, providing the string and a set of tokens that describe the format. For example, you have n8n's founding date, 23rd June 2019, formatted as '23-06-2019'. You want to turn this into a Luxon object: 1 {{ DateTime . fromFormat ( \"23-06-2019\" , \"dd-MM-yyyy\" )}} When using ad-hoc parsing, note Luxon's warning about Limitations . If you see unexpected results, try their Debugging guide. Get the time between two dates # To get the time between two dates, use Luxon's diffs feature. This subtracts one date from another and returns a duration. For example, get the number of months between two dates: 1 {{ DateTime . fromISO ( '201-06-23' ). diff ( DateTime . fromISO ( '2019-05-23' ), 'months' ). toObject ()}} This returns [Object: {\"months\":1}] . Refer to Luxon's Diffs for more information. A longer example: how many days to Christmas? # This example brings together several Luxon features, uses JMESPath, and does some basic string manipulation. The scenario: you want a countdown to 25th December. Every day, it should tell you the number of days remaining to Christmas. You don't want to update it for next year - it needs to seamelessly work for every year. 1 {{ \"There are \" + $today . diff ( DateTime . fromISO ( $today . year + '-12-25' ), 'days' ). toObject (). days . toString (). substring ( 1 ) + \" days to Christmas!\" }} This outputs \"There are <number of days> days to Christmas!\" . For example, on 9th March, it outputs \"There are 291 days to Christmas!\". A detailed explanation of what the expression does: {{ : indicates the start of the expression. \"There are \" : a string. + : used to join two strings. $today.diff() : This is similar to the example in Get the time between two dates , but it uses n8n's custom $today variable. DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days' : this part gets the current year using $today.year , turns it into an ISO string along with the month and date, and then takes the whole ISO string and converts it to a Luxon DateTime data structure. It also tells Luxon that you want the duration in days. toObject() turns the result of diff() into a more usable object. At this point, the expression returns [Object: {\"days\":-<number-of-days>}] . For example, on 9th March, [Object: {\"days\":-291}] . .days uses JMESPath syntax to retrieve just the number of days from the object. For more information on using JMESPath with n8n, refer to our JMESpath documentation. This gives you the number of days to Christmas, as a negative number. .toString().substring(1) turns the number into a string and removes the - . + \" days to Christmas!\" : another string, with a + to join it to the previous string. }} : indicates the end of the expression.","title":"Data and time with Luxon"},{"location":"code-examples/expressions/luxon/#date-and-time-with-luxon","text":"Luxon is a JavaScript library that makes it easier to work with date and time.

We will walk through the canvas and show you what each icon means and where to find things you will need while building workflows in n8n. Getting started # First of all, you need to get n8n. There are different ways to set up n8n , choose the option that best suits your skills and needs. This course was developed on n8n version 0.127.0. In newer versions, the Editor UI might look different, but the core functionality of the workflows should not be impacted. Once you have n8n running, open the Editor UI in a browser window. It should look like this: Editor UI Now that you have the Editor UI open, you'll learn how to navigate it. Editor UI settings # The Editor UI represents the web interface used to create workflows . Think of it as a canvas where the artist in you will create automations. From the Editor UI you can access all your workflows and credentials, as well as the n8n documentation and forum. Left-side panel # Under the n8n logo in the upper left corner you will notice a round arrow icon. Click on it to open the left-side menu, which contains the core functionalities and settings for managing workflows. Editor UI left-side menu There are four main sections in the left menu: Admin Panel : Only for users on n8n.cloud, used to access the management Dashboard. Workflows : Contains operations for creating and editing workflows. Credentials : Contains operations for creating credentials. Executions : Contains information about your workflow executions, which are complete runs of a workflow from the first to the last node. Help : Contains resources around n8n product and community. Top bar # The top bar of the Editor UI contains four pieces of information: Editor UI top bar The text that appears in the top left is the name of the current workflow. You can edit this name anytime. Next to it, you have the option to add a tag . Tags help you organize your workflows by use case, domain, or whatever is relevant for you. In the top right there is an orange Save button that saves the current workflow. Next to it, there is a toggle button used to activate or deactivate the current workflow. Canvas # The canvas is the gray grid background in the Editor UI. On the canvas, there are five buttons and a node with different functionalities: Workflow canvas In the bottom left corner of the canvas there are three small icons used to zoom in ( + ) or out ( - ) of the canvas, and reset ( \u2190 ) the canvas to the original resolution. At the bottom center of the canvas there is an orange Execute Workflow button. When you click on it all nodes on the canvas are executed. On the top right corner of the canvas there is an orange circle with a + sign inside. This button opens the nodes panel. In the center of the canvas, there is a square with a green play icon inside. This is the Start node . You will learn more about nodes in the next section . Moving the canvas You can move the workflow canvas around in two ways: - Click Ctrl + Left Mouse Button on the canvas and move it around - Place two fingers on your touchpad and slide Don\u2019t worry about workflow execution and activation for now, we will explain these concepts later on in the course. Nodes # You can think of nodes as building blocks that serve different functions but, when put together, they make up a functioning machinery \u2013 an automated workflow. Node A node is an individual step in your workflow \u2014 one that either (a) loads, (b) processes or (c) sends data. Based on their function, nodes can be classified into two types: Regular Nodes add, remove, and edit data, as well as request and send external data. Trigger Nodes start a workflow and supply the initial data. Keep in mind Among the Regular and Trigger nodes there are some nodes that do not represent any app or service, instead they serve general functions like scheduling workflows (e.g. Cron and Interval nodes) or adding JavaScript functions (e.g. Function and Function Item nodes). We refer to these as Core Nodes . Start node # The Start node is the default starting point in any workflow. Every time you create a new workflow, a Start node will be included by default. Start node The Start node cannot be deleted or duplicated. If you have a workflow in which you don\u2019t use the Start node, you can remove the connection, deactivate it, and move it away from the workflow. If you need more than one Start node, you probably need to use other Trigger nodes or create separate workflows. You\u2019ve probably figured out already that the Start node is a Core Trigger node. Apart from it, there are over 290 other Regular and Trigger nodes for various functions, apps, and services. Finding nodes # You can find all available nodes in the nodes panel on the right side of the Editor UI. There are three ways in which you can open the nodes panel: Click the + icon in the top right corner of the canvas. Click the gray dot on the right side of an existing node on the canvas (the node to which you want to add another one) and pull the connection line to the right. Click the Tab key on your keyboard. The nodes panel looks like this: Nodes panel In the nodes panel, notice that the nodes are grouped in three tabs: All, Regular, and Trigger. In addition, nodes are also grouped by their functionality domain (like Analytics or Sales). This makes it easier to find the nodes you need. If you want to get a specific node, type in the name of the node, app, or service in the search field and select the respective tab. Adding nodes # To add a new node to the Editor UI, click on the node you want in the nodes panel. The new node will automatically be connected to the selected node on the canvas. To review, here\u2019s a walkthrough of the Editor UI touching on all the settings you\u2019ve learned so far: Editor UI walkthrough Node buttons # If you hover on a node, you\u2019ll notice that four icons appear on top: Delete the node Deactivate/Activate the node Duplicate the node Execute the node The four node buttons Moving a workflow To move a workflow around the canvas, select all nodes ( Ctrl + A ), click and hold on a node then drag it to any point you want on the canvas.

A simple, yet useful, automation is getting articles from Hacker News so that you\u2019re up to date with the tech world. More specifically, let\u2019s say you want to get the latest 10 articles related to automation. You can build a workflow for this use case in 4 steps: 1. Add the Hacker News node 2. Configure the Hacker News node 3. Save the workflow 4. Execute the node 1. Add the Hacker News node # Open the nodes panel, search for the Hacker News node, and click on it to add it to the Editor UI. Connect the Hacker News node to the Start node . 2. Configure the Hacker News node # When you add a new node to the Editor UI, the node will be automatically activated and open a window with two tabs on the left side: Parameters and Settings . Parameters vs Settings Parameters are different for each node, depending on its functionality. Settings are the same for all nodes. Parameters # The Hacker News node has several parameters that need to be configured in order to make it work: Resource: All This resource selects all data records (articles). Operation: Get All This operation fetches all the selected articles. Limit: 10 This parameter sets a limit to how many results are returned by the Get All operation. Additional fields > Add Field > Keyword: automation Additional fields are options that you can add to certain nodes to make your request more specific or filter the results. In our case, we want to get only articles that include the keyword \u201cautomation\u201d. The configuration of the parameters for the Hacker News node should now look like this: Hacker News node parameters Settings # The Settings section includes several options for node design and executions. In this case, we\u2019ll configure only the first two settings, which set the node\u2019s appearance in the Editor UI. In the Hacker News node settings, edit: Notes: Get the 10 latest articles Node notes It is often helpful, especially for complex or shared workflows, to add a short description in the node about what it does. Display note in flow?: toggle to true This option will display the description note under the node in the Editor UI. The configuration of the settings for the Hacker News node looks like this: Hacker News node renaming Renaming a node You can rename the node with a name that\u2019s more descriptive for your use case. There are two ways to do this: - Double-click on the node to open the node window. Click on the name of the node in the top left corner of the window, rename it as you like, then click on the \u2714 symbol to save the node under the new name. Renaming a node from the window Select the node you want to rename and at the same time press the F2 key on your keyboard. Renaming a node from the keyboard 3. Save the workflow # Save the workflow under the name \u201cHacker News workflow\u201d By default, your workflow is automatically saved as \u201cMy workflow\u201d. There are two ways in which you can save a workflow: From the Canvas in Editor UI, click Ctrl + S or Cmd + S on your keyboard Click the Save button in the top right corner of the Editor UI 4. Execute the node # Click on the Execute Node button in the top right corner of the node window. You should see 10 results in Table view. Results in Table view for the Hacker News node Node executions # Node execution A node execution represents a run of that node to retrieve the specified data. If a node executed successfully a small green circle with a number inside will appear on top of the node. Successfully executed workflow If the parameters are configured correctly and everything works fine, the requested data will be displayed in the node window in Table and JSON format. You can switch between these views by selecting the one you want from the JSON|Table button at the top of the node window. Table vs JSON views The Table view is the default. It displays the requested data in a table, where the rows are the records and the columns are the available attributes of those records. Results in JSON view for the Hacker News node The node window displays more information about the node execution: In the top left corner of the results window, you\u2019ll notice another piece of information: Items : 10 . This field displays the number of items (records) that are returned by the node request. In our case, it\u2019s expected to be 10, since this is the limit we set in the node. But if you don\u2019t set a limit, it\u2019s useful to see how many records are actually returned. Next to the Items information, notice a small orange i icon. If you hover on it, you\u2019ll get two more pieces of information: Start Time (when the node execution started) and Execution Time (how long it took for the node to return the results from the moment it started executing). Start Time and Execution Time can provide insights into the performance of each individual node. In the bottom right corner right under the node window, there is a reference link to the node\u2019s documentation . Check it out if you run into trouble or are not sure how to configure the node\u2019s parameters. Error in nodes A red warning icon on the top right corner of a node means that the node has errors.

To do this: Create an Airtable account . In your Airtable workspace add a new base from scratch and name it, for example, beginner course . Create an Airtable base In the beginner course base you have by default a Table 1 with four fields: Name, Notes, Attachment, and Status .

This if-then-else command is conditional logic. In n8n workflows, conditional logic can be implemented with the IF node , which splits a workflow conditionally based on comparison operations. IF vs Switch If you need to filter data on more than two conditional routes that are possible with the IF node (true and false), use the Switch node . The Switch node is similar to the IF node, but supports up to four conditional routes. Back to your workflow, remove the connection between the HTTP Request node and the Airtable node.

These settings are located in the left panel, under the Workflows section. Workflow Settings In the Workflow Settings window you can configure six settings: Error Workflow : A workflow to run in case the execution of the current workflow fails. Timezone: The timezone to use in the current workflow. If not set, the global Timezone (by default \"New York\") is used. This setting is particularly important for the Cron node, as you want to make sure that the workflow gets executed at the right time. Save Data Error Execution: If the Execution data of the workflow should be saved when it fails. Save Data Success Execution: If the Execution data of the workflow should be saved when it succeeds. Save Manual Executions: If executions started from the Editor UI should be saved. Save Execution Progress: If the execution data of each node should be saved. If Yes, you can resume the workflow from where it stopped in case of an error, though keep in mind that this might make the execution slower.

In n8n this repetitive processing is handled automatically, meaning you do not need to specifically build loops into your workflows. There are some special cases where this isn\u2019t true. Using loops in n8n # n8n nodes take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can think of each item as a single data point (or a single row in the output table of a node). The following image shows the output from the Customer Datastore node, where each row is an individual item. Nodes usually run once for each item . For example, if you want to send the name and notes of the customers as a message on Slack , connect the Slack node to the Customer Datastore node, configure the parameters, and execute the node. You will receive 5 messages \u2014 one for each item. This is how you can process multiple items without having to explicitly connect nodes in a loop. Keep in mind Your data must be in the proper structure for n8n to process it as described here. See Transforming Data to learn more.

However, there are certain scenarios where you will have to create a loop to iterate through all items. You can learn more about these here . To create a loop in an n8n workflow, connect the output of one node to the input of a previous node. Make sure you add an IF node to check when to stop the loop. You now have a loop that iterates over each item. Here is an example workflow that implements a loop with an IF node: You should use the Split In Batches node when you want to batch the data in groups and process these batches. This approach is useful for avoiding API rate limits when processing large incoming data or when you only want to process a specific group of returned items.

For example: 1 2 3 4 5 n8n : environment : - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE=true - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER=<user> - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=<password> Or using the -e flag from the command line: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 docker run -it --rm \\ --name n8n \\ -p 5678 :5678 \\ -e N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE = \"true\" \\ -e N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER = \"<user>\" \\ -e N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD = \"<password>\" \\ n8nio/n8n Configuration via file # It is also possible to configure n8n using a configuration file. Only the values that should be different from the default need to be defined in your configuration file. If needed multiple files can also be supplied. For example, you can have some generic base settings and some specific ones depending on the environment. The path to the JSON configuration file to use can be set using the environment variable N8N_CONFIG_FILES . 1 2 3 4 5 # Single file export N8N_CONFIG_FILES = /folder/my-config.json # Multiple files can be comma-separated export N8N_CONFIG_FILES = /folder/my-config.json,/folder/production.json A possible configuration file could look like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 { \"executions\" : { \"process\" : \"main\" , \"saveDataOnSuccess\" : \"none\" }, \"generic\" : { \"timezone\" : \"Europe/Berlin\" }, \"security\" : { \"basicAuth\" : { \"active\" : true , \"user\" : \"frank\" , \"password\" : \"some-secure-password\" } }, \"nodes\" : { \"exclude\" : \"[\\\"n8n-nodes-base.executeCommand\\\",\\\"n8n-nodes-base.writeBinaryFile\\\"]\" } } You can also append _FILE to some individual environment variables to provide their configuration in a separate file, enabling you to avoid passing sensitive details via environment variables. n8n will then load the data from the file with the given name, making it possible to easily load data from Docker- and Kubernetes-Secrets. The following environment variables support file input: CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_DATA_FILE DB_TYPE_FILE DB_MYSQLDB_DATABASE_FILE DB_MYSQLDB_HOST_FILE DB_MYSQLDB_PORT_FILE DB_MYSQLDB_USER_FILE DB_MYSQLDB_PASSWORD_FILE DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE_FILE DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST_FILE DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD_FILE DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT_FILE DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_CA_FILE DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_CERT_FILE DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_KEY_FILE DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED_FILE DB_POSTGRESDB_USER_FILE DB_POSTGRESDB_SCHEMA_FILE N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD_FILE N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER_FILE N8N_BASIC_AUTH_HASH_FILE N8N_JWT_AUTH_HEADER_FILE N8N_JWKS_URI_FILE N8N_JWT_AUTH_HEADER_VALUE_PREFIX_FILE N8N_JWT_ISSUER_FILE N8N_JWT_NAMESPACE_FILE N8N_JWT_ALLOWED_TENANT_FILE N8N_JWT_ALLOWED_TENANT_KEY_FILE Examples # Base URL # Keep in mind This variable only gets used when the n8n-editor-ui package gets built manually.

For example, if you want to set the timeout to one hour: 1 export EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT = 3600 You can also set maximum execution time (in seconds) for each workflow individually.

There is one owner account for each n8n instance. You can't transfer ownership. The owner can: Add and remove users See all workflows Delete tags Members: these are normal n8n users. Members can: See all workflow tags, create new tags, and assign tags to their workflows. Members can't delete tags. Change their own password. See their own workflows. Create a member-level account for the owner We recommend that owners create a member-level account for themselves. Owners can see all workflows, but there is no way to see who created a particular workflow, so there is a risk of overriding other people's work if you build and edit workflows as an owner.

Step one: SMTP # You need an SMTP server for user management to send invites and password resets. Get the following information from your SMTP provider: Server name SMTP username SMTP password SMTP sender name To set up SMTP with n8n, configure the SMTP environment variables for your n8n instance. For information on how to set environment variables, refer to Configuration Variable Type Description Required? N8N_EMAIL_MODE string smtp Required N8N_SMTP_HOST string your_SMTP_server_name Required N8N_SMTP_PORT number your_SMTP_server_port Default is 465 . Optional N8N_SMTP_USER string your_SMTP_username Required N8N_SMTP_PASS string your_SMTP_password Required N8N_SMTP_SENDER string You can select the sender name from the sender addresses. Example: \"N8N contact@n8n.com \" Required N8N_SMTP_SSL boolean Whether to use SSL for SMTP (true) or not (false). Defaults to true . Optional N8N_UM_EMAIL_TEMPLATES_INVITE string Full path to your HTML email template. This overrides the default template for invite emails. Optional N8N_UM_EMAIL_TEMPLATES_PWRESET string Full path to your HTML email template. This overrides the default template for password reset emails. Optional If your n8n instance is already running, you need to restart it to enable the new SMTP settings. More configuration options There are more configuration options available as environment variables. Refer to Environment variables for a list. These include options to disable tags, workflow templates, and the personalization survey, if you don't want your users to see them. New to SMTP? If you're not familiar with SMTP, this blog post by SendGrid offers a short introduction, while Wikipedia's Simple Mail Transfer Protocol article provides more detailed technical background. Step two: in-app setup # When you set up user management for the first time, you create an owner account. Open n8n. The app displays a signup screen. Enter your details. Your password must be at least eight characters, including at least one number and one capital letter. Click Next . n8n logs you in with your new owner account. Step three: invite users # You can now invite other people to your n8n instance. Sign in with your owner account. Click your user icon > Settings . n8n opens your Personal settings page. Click Users to go to the Users page. Click Invite . Enter the new user's email address. Click Invite user . n8n sends an email with a link for the new user to join. Manage users # The Users page shows all users, including ones with pending invitations. You can: Delete a user: Click the menu icon by the user you want to delete. Confirm you want to delete them. If they are an active user, choose whether to copy their workflow data and credentials to a new user, or permanently delete their workflows and credentials. Resend an invitation to a pending user: click the menu icon by the user, then click Resend invite . Skipping or disabling user management # You don't have to use n8n's user management feature. You can: Leave it enabled, but choose to skip the setup step. You can use n8n as normal. If you want to set up user management later, go to Settings > Users . Disable the feature completely using the N8N_USER_MANAGEMENT_DISABLED environment variable. Setting this environment variable to true completely hides the feature in your n8n instance. You can't use this setting if you have already set up an owner account. Best practices # This sections contains advice on best practices relating to user management in n8n.

If you are using another database it will be similar, but the data-types will be different depending on the database. The credentials , workflows , executions , and webhook are decoupled and stored in different tables. To inspect the n8n database, you can use DBeaver , which is an open-source universal database tool. Credentials entity # Based on the node you use in a workflow, you may have to use credentials to connect the node with the respective service. These credentials get stored in the credentials_entity table with the following fields. Column Name Data Type Description id INTEGER Auto-incremented and unique for each row name VARCHAR Stores the name of the credentials given by the user data Text Stores the encrypted data type VARCHAR Refers to the credential type used by the node nodeAccess TEXT Stores the information of the nodes that have access to these credentials createdAt DATETIME Stores the date and time when a credential gets created updatedAt DATETIME Stores the date and time when a credential gets updated Below is an example of how n8n stores the credentials in the credentials_entity table in the SQLite database. The example below shows the data stored in the table for the Pipedrive Trial credentials. The name field contains the credentials name, and the data field stores the credentials by encrypting them. The Pipedrive node has two authentication methods - OAuth and Access Token. The type field indicates the method the credentials belong to. The nodeAccess field stores information about the nodes that have access to these credentials. In the example below, both the Pipedrive node and the Pipedrive Trigger node have access to the Pipedrive Trial credentials.

The example below shows the execution data stored in the table for the Receive updates of the position of the ISS every minute workflow. The data field contains the data returned by the nodes after the execution of the workflow. The finished field contains the value 1 , indicating that the execution got completed successfully. The example workflow uses a Trigger node to start the workflow. This information gets stored in the mode field. The workflowData field stores information about the workflow and static data. The workflowId field refers to the workflow that got executed. Migrations # Migration is a file with SQL queries to update a database schema. For example, if a new column gets added to a database, n8n creates a migration. On startup, n8n checks for new migrations. The logs of the migrations that ran get stored in the migrations table. n8n uses this table to check for the migrations that got executed earlier. The migrations table has the following fields. Column Name Data Type Description id INTEGER Auto-incremented and unique for each row timestamp BIGINT Stores the timestamp when the migration ran name VARCHAR Stores the name of the migration that ran Below is an example of how n8n logs the migrations that ran in the migrations table.

Starting n8n # From your terminal, run: 1 2 3 4 5 docker run -it --rm \\ --name n8n \\ -p 5678 :5678 \\ -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n \\ n8nio/n8n This command will download all required n8n images and start your container, exposed on port 5678 . So that all your data is not lost when you stop the container, it also mounts a local directory, .n8n , to persist your data locally. You can then access n8n by opening: http://localhost:5678 Using alternate databases # By default n8n uses SQLite to save credentials, past executions and workflows. n8n also supports PostgresDB, MySQL and MariaDB, configurable via environment variables as detailed below. It is important to still persist data in the /root/.n8n folder as it contains n8n user data and even more importantly the encryption key for credentials. It is also the name of the webhook when the n8n tunnel is used. If no directory is found, n8n creates automatically one on startup. In this case, existing credentials saved with a different encryption key can not be used anymore. Keep in mind Persisting the /root/.n8n directory even when using alternate databases is the recommended best practice, but not explicitly required.

To learn more see the Scaling n8n documentation.","title":"Queue"},{"location":"hosting/scaling/queue-mode/","text":"n8n can be run in different modes depending on your needs. The queue mode provides the best scalability, and its configuration is detailed here. How it works # When running in queue mode you have multiple n8n instances set up (as many as desired or necessary to handle your workload), with one main instance receiving workflow information (e.g. triggers) and the worker instances performing the executions. The workflow information from the n8n main instance is passed to a message broker, Redis , which maintains the queue of pending executions and allows them to be picked up by the next available worker. Each worker is its own Node.js instance, running in main mode, but able to handle multiple simultaneous workflow executions due to their high IOPS (input-output operations per second). By using worker instances and running in queue mode, you can scale n8n up (by adding workers) and down (by removing workers) as needed to handle the workload at any point in time. Configuring workers # Workers are n8n instances that do the actual work. They receive information from the main n8n process about the workflows that have to get executed, execute the workflows, and update the status after each execution is complete. Set encryption key # n8n will automatically generates an encryption key upon first startup. You can also provide your own custom key via environment variable if desired. The encryption key of the main n8n instance must be shared with all worker and webhooks processor nodes to ensure these worker nodes are able to access credentials stored in the database. Set the encryption key for each worker node in a configuration file or by setting the corresponding environment variable: 1 export N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY = <main_instance_encryption_key> Set executions mode # Database considerations We recommend using a database like MySQL or Postgres 13+. Running n8n with execution mode set to queue with an SQLite database is not recommended. Set the environment variable EXECUTIONS_MODE to queue using the following command. 1 export EXECUTIONS_MODE = queue Alternatively, you can set executions.mode to queue in the configuration file . Start Redis # Keep in mind You can run Redis on a separate machine, just make sure that it is accessible by the n8n instance. To run Redis in a Docker container, follow the instructions below. Run the following command to start a Redis instance: 1 docker run --name some-redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis By default, Redis runs on localhost on port 6379 with no password. Based on your Redis configuration, set the following configurations for the main n8n process. These will allow n8n to interact with Redis. Via configuration file Via environment variables Description queue.bull.redis.host:localhost QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_HOST=localhost By default, Redis runs on localhost . queue.bull.redis.port:6379 QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_PORT=6379 The default port is 6379 . If Redis is running on a different port, configure the value. You can also set the following optional configurations: Via configuration file Via environment variables Description queue.bull.redis.password:PASSWORD QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_PASSWORD By default, Redis doesn\u2019t require a password. If you\u2019re using a password, configure it variable. queue.bull.redis.db:0 QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_DB The default value is 0 . If you change this value, update the configuration. queue.bull.redis.timeoutThreshold:10000ms QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_TIMEOUT_THRESHOLD Tells n8n how long it should wait if Redis is unavailable before exiting. The default value is 10000ms . queue.bull.queueRecoveryInterval:60 QUEUE_RECOVERY_INTERVAL Adds an active watchdog to n8n that checks Redis for finished executions. This is used to recover when n8n\u2019s main process loses connection temporarily to Redis and is not notified about finished jobs. The default value is 60 seconds. Now you can start your n8n instance and it will connect to your Redis instance. Start workers # You will need to start worker processes to allow n8n to execute workflows. If you want to host workers on a separate machine, install n8n on the machine and make sure that it is connected to your Redis instance and the n8n database. Start worker processes by running the following command from the root directory: 1 ./packages/cli/bin/n8n worker If you're using Docker, use the following command: 1 docker run --name n8n-queue -p 5679:5678 n8nio/n8n n8n worker You can set up multiple worker processes. Make sure that all the worker processes have access to Redis and the n8n database. Running n8n with queues # When running n8n with queues, all the production workflow executions get processed by worker processes. This means that even the webhook calls get delegated to the worker processes, which might add some overhead and extra latency. However, the manual workflow executions still use the main process. Redis is used as the message broker, and the database is used to persist data, so access to both is required. Running a distributed system with this setup over SQLite is not recommended. Migrate data If you want to migrate data from one database to another, you can use the Export and Import commands. Refer to the CLI commands for n8n documentation to learn how to use these commands. Webhook processors # Keep in mind Webhook processes rely on Redis too. Follow the configure the workers section above to setup webhook processor nodes. Webhook processors are another layer of scaling in n8n. Configuring the webhook processor is optional, and allows you to scale the incoming webhook requests. This method allows n8n to process a huge number of parallel requests. All you have to do is add more webhook processes and workers accordingly. The webhook process will listen to requests on the same port (default: 5678 ). Run these processes in containers or separate machines, and have a load balancing system to route requests accordingly. We do not recommend adding the main process to the load balancer pool. If the main process is added to the pool, it will receive requests and possibly a heavy load. This will result in degraded performance for editing, viewing, and interacting with the n8n UI. You can start the webhook processor by executing the following command from the root directory: 1 ./packages/cli/bin/n8n webhook If you're using Docker, use the following command: 1 docker run --name n8n-queue -p 5679:5678 n8nio/n8n n8n webhook Configure webhook URL # To configure your webhook URL, execute the following command on the machine running the main n8n instance: 1 export WEBHOOK_URL = https://your-webhook-url.com You can also set this value in the configuration file. Configure load balancer # When using multiple webhook processes you will need a load balancer to route requests. If you are using the same domain name for your n8n instance and the webhooks, you can set up your load balancer to route requests as follows: Redirect any request that matches /webhook/* to the webhook servers pool All other paths (the n8n internal API, the static files for the editor, etc.) should get routed to the main process Note: Manual workflow executions still occur on the main process and the default URL for these is /webhook-test/* . Make sure that these URLs route to your main process. You can change this path in the configuration file via endpoints.webhook or via the N8N_ENDPOINT_WEBHOOK environment variable. If you change these, update your load balancer accordingly. Disable webhook processing in the main process (optional) # You have webhook processors to execute the workflows. You can disable the webhook processing in the main process. This will make sure to execute all webhook executions in the webhook processors. In the configuration file set endpoints.disableProductionWebhooksOnMainProcess to true so that n8n does not process webhook requests on the main process. Alternatively, you can use the following command: 1 export N8N_DISABLE_PRODUCTION_MAIN_PROCESS = true When disabling the webhook process in the main process, run the main process and don't add it to the load balancer's webhook pool. Avoiding downtime # When it comes to startup and shutdown, n8n will stop all currently executing workflows, disconnect from sources, and deregister webhooks that might have been registered with third-party services. All this happens inside the main process. A new configuration has been added to n8n that allows it to skip deregistering of webhooks during the shutdown. Whenever n8n starts back, this configuration will check for existing webhooks. If a webhook exists, it will not be registered again. Trigger nodes that do not use HTTP requests will still suffer marginal downtime during the update process. The setting that controls this behavior is endpoint.skipWebhoooksDeregistrationOnShutdown . It defaults to false but can be changed: 1 export N8N_SKIP_WEBHOOK_DEREGISTRATION_SHUTDOWN = true Keep in mind Do not use this procedure for blue/green installations, where you have two n8n instances running simultaneously, but only one is receiving active traffic. If you run two or more main processes simultaneously, the currently active instance gets notified of activation and deactivation of workflows. This can potentially cause duplication of work or even skipping workflows entirely.

The workflow information from the n8n main instance is passed to a message broker, Redis , which maintains the queue of pending executions and allows them to be picked up by the next available worker. Each worker is its own Node.js instance, running in main mode, but able to handle multiple simultaneous workflow executions due to their high IOPS (input-output operations per second). By using worker instances and running in queue mode, you can scale n8n up (by adding workers) and down (by removing workers) as needed to handle the workload at any point in time.","title":"How it works"},{"location":"hosting/scaling/queue-mode/#configuring-workers","text":"Workers are n8n instances that do the actual work.

You can also find the workflow on the website. This example usage workflow would use the following two nodes. - Start - Function The final workflow should look like the following image. 1. Start node # The start node exists by default when you create a new workflow. 2. Function node # Paste the following JavaScript code snippet in the Function field. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 var date = new Date (). toISOString (); var day = new Date (). getDay (); const weekday = [ \"Sunday\" , \"Monday\" , \"Tuesday\" , \"Wednesday\" , \"Thursday\" , \"Friday\" , \"Saturday\" ]; items [ 0 ]. json . date_today = date ; items [ 0 ]. json . day_today = weekday [ day ]; return items ; Click on Execute Node to run the workflow. Node reference # You can also use the methods and variables mentioned in the Expressions page in the Function node. Variable: items # It contains all the items that the node has received as an input. Information about how the data is structured can be found on this page about data structures. The data can be accessed and manipulated like this: 1 2 3 4 5 // Sets the JSON data property \"myFileName\" of the first item to the name of the // file which is set in the binary property \"image\" of the same item. items [ 0 ]. json . myFileName = items [ 0 ]. binary . image . fileName ; return items ; This example creates 10 dummy items with the ids 0 to 9: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 const newItems = []; for ( let i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i ++ ) { newItems . push ({ json : { id : i } }); } return newItems ; Method: $item(index: number, runIndex?: number) # With $item it is possible to access the data of parent nodes. That can be the item data but also the parameters. It expects as input an index of the item the data should be returned for. This is needed because for each item the data returned can be different. This is probably straightforward for the item data itself but maybe less for data like parameters. The reason why it is also needed, is that they may contain an expression. Expressions get always executed of the context for an item. If that would not be the case, for example, the Email Send node not would be able to send multiple emails at once to different people. Instead, the same person would receive multiple emails. The index is 0 based. So $item(0) will return the first item, $item(1) the second one, and so on. By default the item of the last run of the node will be returned. So if the referenced node ran 3x (its last runIndex is 2) and the current node runs the first time (its runIndex is 0) the data of runIndex 2 of the referenced node will be returned. For more information about what data can be accessed via $node , check out the Variable: $node section . Example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 // Returns the value of the JSON data property \"myNumber\" of Node \"Set\" (first item) const myNumber = $item ( 0 ). $node [ \"Set\" ]. json [ \"myNumber\" ]; // Like above but data of the 6th item const myNumber = $item ( 5 ). $node [ \"Set\" ]. json [ \"myNumber\" ]; // Returns the value of the parameter \"channel\" of Node \"Slack\". // If it contains an expression the value will be resolved with the // data of the first item. const channel = $item ( 0 ). $node [ \"Slack\" ]. parameter [ \"channel\" ]; // Like above but resolved with the value of the 10th item. const channel = $item ( 9 ). $node [ \"Slack\" ]. parameter [ \"channel\" ]; Method: getWorkflowStaticData(type) # This gives access to the static workflow data. It is possible to save data directly with the workflow. This data should, however, be very small. A common use case is to for example to save a timestamp of the last item that got processed from an RSS-Feed or database. It will always return an object. Properties can then read, delete or set on that object. When the workflow execution succeeds, n8n will check automatically if the data has changed and will save it, if necessary. There are two types of static data. The \"global\" and the \"node\" one. Global static data is the same in the whole workflow. And every node in the workflow can access it. The node static data , however, is different for every node and only the node which set it can retrieve it again. Example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 // Get the global workflow static data const staticData = getWorkflowStaticData ( 'global' ); // Get the static data of the node const staticData = getWorkflowStaticData ( 'node' ); // Access its data const lastExecution = staticData . lastExecution ; // Update its data staticData . lastExecution = new Date (). getTime (); // Delete data delete staticData . lastExecution ; It is important to know that the static data can not be read and written when testing via the UI.

Aggregate Items : Merge multiple items into a single new item. Remove Duplicates : Remove extraneous items. Sort : Change the ordering of items. Limit : Remove items beyond a defined maximum number. Usually, you shouldn't use expressions for fields that expect a key value (for example, Field to Split Out ). Expressions usually return values, not keys. Split Out Items # This operation is useful if your data contains a list of items, for example a list of customers, and you want to split them so that you have an item for each customer. When using the Split Out Items operation, configure the following parameters and options: Field to Split Out : The field containing the list you want to separate out into individual items (e.g. Name in the example here). Must be plaintext and not an expression. Include : Select if any other fields from the input data should be kept with each new individual item. You can select: No Other Fields All Other Fields Selected Other Fields : When selected, a Fields to Include field is displayed. Enter a comma separated list of desired fields. Disable Dot Notation : When disabled, child fields (in the format parent.child ) cannot be referenced. Destination Field Name : Optionally set the field name under which to put the new split contents. Aggregate Items # The Aggregate Items operations is useful when you want to take many separate items, or just particular portions of them, and group them together into individual items. For example, the image below shows customer names and email addresses being grouped into individual items from a series of individual customer records that contained many other details. When using the Aggregate Items operation, configure the following parameters and options: Field To Aggregate : The name of the field in the input data to be aggregated together. Rename Field : Enable this toggle to enter a field name for the aggregated output data. When aggregating multiple fields you must provide new output field names, multiple fields cannot be left undefined . Output Field Name : Displayed only when Rename Field is enabled. The field name for the aggregated output data. Disable Dot Notation : When disabled, child fields (in the format parent.child ) cannot be referenced. Preserve Aggregated Lists : If enabled, fields to aggregate that are lists will output a list of lists (rather than being merged into a single list). Remove Duplicates # There are many situations where you can end up with duplicate data, a user creating multiple accounts, a customer submitting the same order multiple time, etc. When working with large datasets it becomes more difficult to easily spot and remove these items. The Remove Duplicates operation allows you to identify those items that are identical across all fields or only a desired subset of fields. When using the Remove Duplicates operation, configure the following parameters and options: Compare : Provide which fields of the input data should be compared to check if they are the same. The following options are available: All Fields : Compares all fields of the input data. All Fields Except : Enter which input data fields should be excluded from the comparison.

The webhook URL that will resume the execution when called is only generated at runtime. The Wait node provides the $resumeWebhookUrl variable so that you can reference and send (the yet to be generated URL) wherever needed, for example to a third-party service or in an email (see example below). When the workflow executes, the resume URL is generated and the webhook(s) in your workflow using the $resumeWebhookUrl reference become functional.

Reference # See the Webhook node documentation to learn more about the Authentication, Method, and Response parameters when configuring the Wait node to resume on a webhook call. In addition to the parameters shared with the Webhook mode, the Wait node has the following additional configuration options: Limit wait time : Set the maximum amount of time to wait before the execution is resumed by default (i.e. even with no webhook call received). Add Option > Webhook Suffix : Provide a suffix that you want to appended to the resume URL. This is useful for creating unique webhook URLs for each Wait node when a workflow contains multiple Wait nodes. Note : The generated $resumeWebhookUrl will not automatically include this suffix, you must manually append it to the webhook URL before exposing it. Limitations # There are a few functional limitations to keep in mind when working with the On Webhook Call operations of the Wait node: Partial executions of your workflow will change the $resumeWebhookUrl , so be sure that the node being used to send this URL to your desired third-party runs in the same execution as the Wait node.

It allows you to create webhooks which can be used to receive data from apps and services when an event occurs. It is a Trigger node, which means that it serves as the starting point for an n8n workflow. This allows several different services to connect to n8n and run a workflow when data is received. Keep in mind When using the Webhook node on the localhost, ensure that n8n is running with the tunnel mode: npm with tunnel or Docker with tunnel . When working with a Production webhook, please ensure that you have saved and activated the workflow. Don\u2019t forget that the data flowing through the webhook won\u2019t be visible in the Editor UI with the Production webhook. Webhook nodes can be used as triggers for workflows when we want to receive data and run a workflow based on the data. The Webhook node also supports returning the data generated at the end of a workflow. This makes it very useful to build a workflow to process data and return the results, like an API endpoint. While building or testing a workflow, we recommend that you use a test webhook URL. Using a test webhook ensures that you can view the incoming data in the Editor UI, which is useful for debugging. Make sure that you click on the Execute Node button to register the webhook before sending the data to the test webhook. The test webhook stays active for 120 seconds. \ud83c\udfa5 The following playlist will help you learn how to use the Webhook node in n8n. Node Reference # First of all, in the parameters section, we have the Webhook URLs. Clicking on that will reveal the URLs for the webhook. Here you have two options, let\u2019s understand the difference between them. Webhook URLs Production : A Production webhook is only registered when a workflow has been activated (via the switch on the top right of the page). You will never see its data in the Editor UI. To save the executions, you can either set that as a global default or you can specify that on a per-workflow basis in the workflow settings. You will then see the data from the workflow under \u2018Past Executions\u2019. Test : A Test webhook is only registered in the time between executing a workflow via the UI and until the first call gets made (when it displays \u201cwaiting for Webhook call\u201d). After the Test webhook gets called for the first time, it displays the data in the Editor UI, and then gets deactivated. Authentication: The Webhook node supports two methods of authenticating a request that it receives. Basic Auth \u2014 A method of authentication where the specified username and password must be passed along with the request. Header Auth \u2014 A method of authentication where the specified header parameter must be passed along with the request. This method can be used when you want to authenticate using an API key or an access token, for example. !!! tip Keep in mind The Credential Data required for Header Auth credentials will vary on the type used. For example, if you need to provide an Authorization: Bearer <token> header, the Credential Data Name would be Authorization and the Value would be Bearer <token> . HTTP Method: The Webhook node supports receiving two types of HTTP Requests . GET Request \u2014 GET requests are typically used to request data from a resource. This type of request is typically used to retrieve data from a service. POST Request \u2014 POST requests are typically used to send data to a resource for a create/update operation. This type of request is typically used to send data to a service. Path: By default, this field contains a randomly generated webhook URL path, to avoid conflicts with other webhook nodes. You can also manually specify a URL path if necessary. A good example would be if you were using n8n to prototype an API; and wanted consistent endpoint URLs. Response Code: Allows you to customize the HTTP response code that the Webhook node will return upon successful execution. Response When: This dropdown list allows you to select between two response modes. Webhook received: When this option is selected, the Webhook node will return the specified response code along with the message \u201cWorkflow got started.\u201d. Last node finishes: When this option is selected, the Webhook node will return the specified response code along with the data output from the last node executed in the workflow. Optional Parameters: The Webhook node also supports several optional methods that can be used during configuration. Response Headers \u2014 This option allows you to specify additional headers in the Webhook response. Raw Body \u2014 This option is used to specify when the Webhook node will receive data in a RAW format, such as JSON or XML. Binary Data \u2014 This option is available only when the Webhook node is set to receive POST requests. Setting this to \u2018true\u2019 lets the Webhook node know that it will receive binary data (such as an image/audio). You can use this option when you expect to receive a file via your Webhook node. Conditional Parameters: The Webhook node also supports several other parameters, that are used only in certain configurations. Response Data: This option is available only when set to respond when \u2018Last node finishes\u2019. It allows you to choose which data to return: All Entries \u2014 Choose this option to return all the data generated by the last node in the workflow, as an array. First Entry JSON \u2014 Choose this option to return the first data entry of the last node in the workflow, as a JSON object. First Entry Binary \u2014 Choose this option to return the binary data of the first entry of the last node in the workflow, as a binary file. Example Usage # This workflow allows you to receive the weather information of a city using the Webhook and the OpenWeatherMap nodes. You can also find the workflow on n8n.io. This example usage workflow uses the following nodes. - Webhook - OpenWeatherMap - Set The final workflow should look like the following image. 1. Webhook node # This node will trigger the workflow. We will make a GET request to the Test URL and pass on a query parameter city . We will use the value of this query parameter in the next node in the workflow. Click on Webhook URLs and select the 'Test' tab. Copy the displayed URL. We will make a GET request to this URL later on. Select 'Last Node' from the Response Mode . This will return the data from the last executed node. Select 'All Entries' from the Response Data . This will return all the entries of the last executed node. Save the workflow to register the webhook. Click on Execute Node to run the node. In a new browser tab, paste the URL you copied in the previous step and append it with ?city=Berlin . Your URL should look similar to the following URL: https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path?city=Berlin . We are passing a query parameter city and assigning it the value Berlin . Press Enter (or Return) to make a request to the Test Webhook URL. In the screenshot below, you will notice that the node triggers the workflow and receives a query parameter. We will use the value of the query parameter in the next node in the workflow. 2. OpenWeatherMap node (Current Weather) # This node will return data about the current weather for the city that we received in the previous node. First of all, you'll have to enter credentials for the OpenWeatherMap node. You can find out how to do that here . Click on the gears icon next to the City field and click on Add Expression . Select the following in the Variable Selector section: Nodes > Webhook > Output Data > JSON > query > city. You can also add the following expression: {{$node[\"Webhook\"].json[\"query\"][\"city\"]}} . Click on Execute Node to run the node. In the screenshot below, you will notice that the node returns data about the current weather in Berlin. 3. Set node # We will use the Set node to ensure that only the data that we set in this node gets returned to the workflow. We will set the value of temp and description in this node. Click on Add Value and select 'String' from the dropdown list. Enter temp in the Name field. Click on the gears icon next to the Value field and click on Add Expression . Select the following in the Variable Selector section: Nodes > OpenWeatherMap > Output Data > JSON > main > temp. You can also add the following expression: {{$node[\"OpenWeatherMap\"].json[\"main\"][\"temp\"]}} . Click on Add Value and select 'String' from the dropdown list. Enter description in the Name field. Click on the gears icon next to the Value field and click on Add Expression . Select the following in the Variable Selector section: Nodes > OpenWeatherMap > Output Data > JSON > weather > [Item: 0] > description. You can also add the following expression: {{$node[\"OpenWeatherMap\"].json[\"weather\"][0][\"description\"]}} . Toggle Keep Only Set to true . We set this option to true to ensure that only the data that we have set in this node get passed on to the next nodes in the workflow. Click on Execute Node to run the node. In the screenshot below, you will notice that the node sets the values of temp and description . Save the workflow and execute it again by clicking on the Execute Workflow button in the Editor UI. This time you will receive the temperature and description as the response in the browser. Activate workflow for production This example workflow uses the Webhook node, which is a Trigger node. You'll need to save the workflow and then click on the Activate toggle on the top right of the screen to activate the workflow. Your workflow will then be triggered every time a GET request is sent to the Production webhook URL. FAQs # Where to find the Webhook URLs? # The Webhook node has two URLs - Test URL and Production URL. To get these URLs, follow the steps mentioned below. 1. Click on Webhook URLs . By default, the node displays the Production URL. 2. If you want the Test URL, click on the Test tab. 3. To copy the URL, click on the displayed URL. Here is a GIF demonstrating how to retrieve the test and production webhook URLs in n8n. How to use the HTTP Request node to trigger the Webhook node? # The HTTP Request node is used to make HTTP requests to the URL you specify. To use the HTTP Request node to trigger the Webhook node, follow the steps mentioned below. 1. Create a new workflow. 2. Add the HTTP Request node to the workflow. 3. Select the appropriate method from the Request Method dropdown list.

Prerequisites # You have knowledge of: JavaScript/TypeScript REST APIs Expressions in n8n Install the following tools: Git: You can find instructions on how to install Git here . Node.js and npm: You can find instructions how to install both using nvm (Node Version Manager) here . The current minimum version is 14.15 . In case you already have Node.js and npm installed, you can check the current version with the following command: bash node -v npm -v NOTE: Use node version 14.x and npm version 6.x . If using npm version 7+ , you must enable legacy peer dependencies by setting: npm config set legacy-peer-deps true . Lerna: You can install lerna globally with the following command: 1 npm install --global lerna Selecting the node # The first thing that we have to do is pick the service we want to create the node for. We will use SendGrid as an example. For the sake of brevity, we will only showcase how to add the functionality to create a contact. Since n8n's repository already has a SendGrid node, we will name this node FriendGrid to avoid conflicts. Cloning the repository # In GitHub, fork the n8n repository . Clone it by running the following command in your terminal (don't forget to replace <USERNAME> with your GitHub username): 1 git clone https://github.com/<USERNAME>/n8n.git && cd n8n n8n is built from four main packages: cli core editor-ui nodes-base All these packages are under the /packages folder in the main n8n folder. We will be working in the nodes-base folder as it contains everything related to nodes. Specifically, /packages/nodes-base/nodes , packages/nodes-base/credentials , and packages/nodes-base/package.json . The folder nodes , contains all the nodes in n8n. The folder credentials contains all the credentials that the different nodes use. Each node can define multiple credentials. For example, OAuth2 or API Key. Each credential requires different parameters that the user will have to input. The credentials data that the user provides is stored in an encrypted format in n8n's database. The file package.json contains all the npm packages that the nodes use. It also contains all the nodes and credentials that are loaded when n8n is started. Creating the node # Go to packages/nodes-base/nodes . Create a folder called FriendGrid (the folder names are PascalCase). Within the FriendGrid folder, create a file called FriendGrid.node.ts (YourNodeName.node.ts). Download and add the FriendGrid icon to the folder. Name it friendGrid.svg . The icon property has to be either a 60x60 pixels PNG or an SVG and must exist in the node\u2019s folder. An SVG is preferable. In case you have to use a PNG, make sure that it is compressed. A good tool for that is tinypng . A good place to find company icons is gilbarbara/logos . Paste the following code in the FriendGrid.node.ts file. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 import { IExecuteFunctions , } from 'n8n-core' ; import { IDataObject , INodeExecutionData , INodeType , INodeTypeDescription , } from 'n8n-workflow' ; import { OptionsWithUri , } from 'request' ; export class FriendGrid implements INodeType { description : INodeTypeDescription = { displayName : 'FriendGrid' , name : 'friendGrid' , icon : 'file:friendGrid.svg' , group : [ 'transform' ], version : 1 , description : 'Consume FriendGrid API' , defaults : { name : 'FriendGrid' , color : '#1A82e2' , }, inputs : [ 'main' ], outputs : [ 'main' ], credentials : [ ], properties : [ // Node properties which the user gets displayed and // can change on the node. ], }; async execute ( this : IExecuteFunctions ) : Promise < INodeExecutionData [][] > { return [[]]; } } Your directory structure should now look like the following. Adding the node to Editor UI # n8n uses the properties set in the property description to render the node in the Editor UI. These properties are displayName , name , color , icon , description , and subtitle . Check the following figure to see how the properties affect the looks of the node. Note: The property description conforms to INodeTypeDescription . Let's see how the node looks in the UI by following these steps: Go to /packages/nodes-base/package.json . Paste \"dist/nodes/FriendGrid/FriendGrid.node.js\", in the nodes array to register the node (in an alphabetical order). Go to the project's main folder (n8n) in the terminal and run the following commands (it can take a few minutes). The first command installs all dependencies of all the modules and links them together. The second command builds all the code. The third command starts n8n in development mode. 1 2 3 lerna bootstrap --hoist npm run build npm run dev Open your browser and go to localhost:8080 and you should be able to see the Editor UI. Open the Create Node menu, type FriendGrid , and click on it to add the node to the Editor UI. Notes - On startup, n8n will load all the nodes and credentials (more about credentials later) that are registered in /packages/nodes-base/package.json . - The property description.name uses camelCase. - The property description.color is the company branding's hexadecimal color. This is usually available on the company's website under style guide. In case the website does not include this information, there are other websites that help you get a company\u2019s branding colors. For example, brandpalettes.com . Creating the UI for the node # Double-clicking on the FriendGrid node will open the Node Editor View. It will be empty since we haven't added any UI components yet. Luckily, n8n provides predefined JSON-based UI components that we can use to ask the user for different types of data. SendGrid's docs mention that to create a contact, we need to provide the following pieces of information: email - Required first_name - Optional last_name - Optional There are more parameters that can be provided to create a contact in FriendGrid, but we will use only these three in this tutorial. Resources and operations # Now, n8n requires a couple of parameters as well: resource - Required operation - Required You can get the node to work without these two parameters, but these should be added for the sake of consistency with the other nodes. Resources and Operations help in organizing all the functionalities of a node. These ensure that all the functionalities of a node remain easily discoverable as the node grows. The resource value is always singular and its value is the name of the API resource that we want to use. Since we are working with contacts, the resource value would be contact . The operation value is always singular as well and it is the name of the operation to perform over the resource. Since we are creating contacts, the operation value would be create . You might say that you can \u201cAdd a contact\u201d and you are right, but we try to use the same operations (create, delete, get, getAll and update) across all the nodes. Adding required fields # Let\u2019s make the Node Editor View ask for these parameters: Add the following under description.properties in packages/nodes-base/nodes/FriendGrid/FriendGrid.node.ts . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 { displayName : 'Resource' , name : 'resource' , type : 'options' , options : [ { name : 'Contact' , value : 'contact' , }, ], default : 'contact' , required : true , description : 'Resource to consume' , }, { displayName : 'Operation' , name : 'operation' , type : 'options' , displayOptions : { show : { resource : [ 'contact' , ], }, }, options : [ { name : 'Create' , value : 'create' , description : 'Create a contact' , }, ], default : 'create' , description : 'The operation to perform.' , }, { displayName : 'Email' , name : 'email' , type : 'string' , required : true , displayOptions : { show : { operation : [ 'create' , ], resource : [ 'contact' , ], }, }, default : '' , description : 'Primary email for the contact' , }, Stop the current n8n process by pressing ctrl + c in the terminal in which you are running n8n. Run again, by entering the following in the terminal. 1 npm run dev Go to localhost:8080 , refresh the page, and open the node again. The node should now look like in the following image. Adding optional fields # We have given the node the possibility to ask for all the required parameters needed to create a contact. But, what about the optional parameters? We can add them below the email parameter and set required: false . However, if we had more than two optional parameters, and most APIs do, the UI would become overwhelming for the users. To avoid this, we use a UI element named collection (usually called 'Additional Fields') to group all the optional parameters together. Add the following below the email field in packages/nodes-base/nodes/FriendGrid/FriendGrid.node.ts . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 { displayName : 'Additional Fields' , name : 'additionalFields' , type : 'collection' , placeholder : 'Add Field' , default : {}, displayOptions : { show : { resource : [ 'contact' , ], operation : [ 'create' , ], }, }, options : [ { displayName : 'First Name' , name : 'firstName' , type : 'string' , default : '' , }, { displayName : 'Last Name' , name : 'lastName' , type : 'string' , default : '' , }, ], }, Stop the current n8n process by pressing ctrl + c in the terminal in which you are running n8n. Run again, by entering the following in the terminal. 1 npm run dev Go to localhost:8080 , refresh the page, and open the node again. The node should now look like in the following image. Now all our optional fields are presented in the UI and can be set individually depending on the user\u2019s use-case. Creating the UI for credentials # Most REST APIs use some sort of authentication mechanism. FriendGrid's REST API uses API Keys. The API Key informs them about who is making the request to their system and gives you access to all the functionality that the API provides. Given all the things it can do, this has to be treated as a sensitive piece of information and should be kept private. n8n gives you the ability to ask for sensitive information using credentials. In the credentials, you can use all the generally available UI elements. Additionally, the data that is stored using the credentials would be encrypted before being saved to the database. In order to do that, n8n uses an encryption key. With that in mind, let\u2019s create the UI to ask for the user\u2019s FriendGrid API Key. The process of creating and registering credentials is similar to that of creating and registering the node: Go to packages/nodes-base/credentials . Within the credentials folder, create a file named FriendGridApi.credentials.ts . Paste the following code. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 import { ICredentialType , NodePropertyTypes , } from 'n8n-workflow' ; export class FriendGridApi implements ICredentialType { name = 'friendGridApi' ; displayName = 'FriendGrid API' ; documentationUrl = 'friendGrid' ; properties = [ { displayName : 'API Key' , name : 'apiKey' , type : 'string' as NodePropertyTypes , default : '' , }, ]; } Go to /packages/nodes-base/package.json . Paste \"dist/credentials/FriendGridApi.credentials.js\", in the credentials array to register the credentials (in an alphabetical order). Got to packages/nodes-base/nodes/FriendGrid/FriendGrid.node.ts . Associate the credentials with the node by adding the following to description.credentials . 1 2 3 4 { name : 'friendGridApi' , required : true , }, Stop the current n8n process by pressing ctrl + c in the terminal in which you are running n8n. Run again, by entering the following in the terminal. 1 npm run dev When you go to the Node Editor view, you should see the following. Mapping the UI fields to the API # With the UI that we added, we now have all the data that we need to make a request to the FriendGrid API and create contacts. This is where the execute method comes into play. Every time the node is executed, this method will be run. Within this method, we can have access to the input items and to the parameters that the user set in the UI, including the credentials. To map the fields to the API, perform the following steps: Go to package/nodes-base/nodes/FriendGrid.node.ts . Replace the current execute method with the following code. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 async execute ( this : IExecuteFunctions ) : Promise < INodeExecutionData [][] > { let responseData ; const resource = this . getNodeParameter ( 'resource' , 0 ) as string ; const operation = this . getNodeParameter ( 'operation' , 0 ) as string ; //Get credentials the user provided for this node const credentials = await this . getCredentials ( 'friendGridApi' ) as IDataObject ; if ( resource === 'contact' ) { if ( operation === 'create' ) { // get email input const email = this . getNodeParameter ( 'email' , 0 ) as string ; // get additional fields input const additionalFields = this . getNodeParameter ( 'additionalFields' , 0 ) as IDataObject ; const data : IDataObject = { email , }; Object . assign ( data , additionalFields ); //Make http request according to <https://sendgrid.com/docs/api-reference/> const options : OptionsWithUri = { headers : { 'Accept' : 'application/json' , 'Authorization' : `Bearer ${ credentials . apiKey } ` , }, method : 'PUT' , body : { contacts : [ data , ], }, uri : `https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/marketing/contacts` , json : true , }; responseData = await this . helpers . request ( options ); } } // Map data to n8n data return [ this . helpers . returnJsonArray ( responseData )]; } Stop the current n8n process by pressing ctrl + c in the terminal in which you are running n8n. Run again, by entering the following in the terminal. 1 npm run dev Enter the credentials (FriendGrid API Key), contact parameters, and execute the node. Instructions to find the FriendGrid API Key can be found here . If everything went well, you should see the following. Now we can successfully create contacts in FriendGrid from n8n. Processing multiples items # In real life, you'll probably have a workflow with more than one node. Our current implementation does not play well with the other nodes. If the data is coming into our FriendGrid node from another node, and that outputs, for example, two contacts, our node will process just the first contact. We want our node to process as many items as it receives. This is when the this.getInputData() function comes into play. Let's update our node so that it can process multiple items. In the Editor UI, create a new workflow. Add a Function node and connect it to the Start node. Open the function node and replace the existing code with the following. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 return [ { json : { name : 'ricardo@n8n.io' } }, { json : { name : 'hello@n8n.io' } }, ] Execute the Function node. We're using the function node for testing, but you can think of it as any node that is returning \u201ctwo people\u201d (or more). These two people need to be added to FriendGrid as contacts. Add a FriendGrid node to the workflow and connect it to the Function node. Add an expression in the Email field of the FriendGrid node and reference the name property that the Function node outputs. Replace the existing execute method with the following: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 async execute ( this : IExecuteFunctions ) : Promise < INodeExecutionData [][] > { const items = this . getInputData (); let responseData ; const returnData = []; const resource = this . getNodeParameter ( 'resource' , 0 ) as string ; const operation = this . getNodeParameter ( 'operation' , 0 ) as string ; //Get credentials the user provided for this node const credentials = await this . getCredentials ( 'friendGridApi' ) as IDataObject ; for ( let i = 0 ; i < items . length ; i ++ ) { if ( resource === 'contact' ) { if ( operation === 'create' ) { // get email input const email = this . getNodeParameter ( 'email' , i ) as string ; // i = 1 returns ricardo@n8n.io // i = 2 returns hello@n8n.io // get additional fields input const additionalFields = this . getNodeParameter ( 'additionalFields' , i ) as IDataObject ; const data : IDataObject = { email , }; Object . assign ( data , additionalFields ); //Make http request according to <https://sendgrid.com/docs/api-reference/> const options : OptionsWithUri = { headers : { 'Accept' : 'application/json' , 'Authorization' : `Bearer ${ credentials . apiKey } ` , }, method : 'PUT' , body : { contacts : [ data , ], }, uri : `https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/marketing/contacts` , json : true , }; responseData = await this . helpers . request ( options ); returnData . push ( responseData ); } } } // Map data to n8n data structure return [ this . helpers . returnJsonArray ( returnData )]; } Execute the workflow. If you open the FriendGrid node, you should see the following. ![Output of the FriendGrid node]((/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/code/final-friendgrid.png) As showcased above, both the items were processed. That\u2019s how all nodes in n8n work (with a few exceptions). They will automatically iterate over all the items and process them. Let\u2019s go over the final version of the execute method. We are getting the items returned by the this.getInputData() function and iterating over all of them. Additionally, while doing so, we use the item index to get the correct parameter value using the function this.getNodeParameters() . For example, with the following input: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 [ { json : { name : 'ricardo@n8n.io' } }, { json : { name : 'hello@n8n.io' } }, ] The this.getNodeParameters(ParameterName, index) function outputs the following: Index Parameter Name Output 0 email ricardo@n8n.io 1 email hello@n8n.io We used the this.helpers.request(options) method to make the HTTP Request that creates the contact in FriendGrid. The FriendGrid endpoint returns something like this: 1 2 3 { job_id : \"b82aca74-3640-4097-85ec-7801d833c2cb\" } We then used the this.helpers.returnJsonArray() method to map the API\u2019s output data to n8n's data structure. The node then ends up returning the data like the following: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 [ { json : { job_id : \"b82aca74-3640-4097-85ec-7801d833c2cb\" } } ] Summary # In this tutorial, we implemented the \"Create a Contact\" functionality of the FriendGrid API. First of all, we made the node show up in the Editor UI and in the Create Node menu with FriendGrid's branding. Then, we added the fields necessary to create a contact in FriendGrid. We also added the credentials so that the API Key could be stored safely. Finally, we mapped all the parameters to the FriendGrid API. This is just the tip of the iceberg. We built a regular node that consumes a REST API, but a regular node can do everything that can be done with Node.js. Aside from regular nodes you can also build Trigger nodes.

If you open the FriendGrid node, you should see the following. ![Output of the FriendGrid node]((/_images/integrations/creating-nodes/code/final-friendgrid.png) As showcased above, both the items were processed. That\u2019s how all nodes in n8n work (with a few exceptions). They will automatically iterate over all the items and process them. Let\u2019s go over the final version of the execute method. We are getting the items returned by the this.getInputData() function and iterating over all of them. Additionally, while doing so, we use the item index to get the correct parameter value using the function this.getNodeParameters() . For example, with the following input: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 [ { json : { name : 'ricardo@n8n.io' } }, { json : { name : 'hello@n8n.io' } }, ] The this.getNodeParameters(ParameterName, index) function outputs the following: Index Parameter Name Output 0 email ricardo@n8n.io 1 email hello@n8n.io We used the this.helpers.request(options) method to make the HTTP Request that creates the contact in FriendGrid. The FriendGrid endpoint returns something like this: 1 2 3 { job_id : \"b82aca74-3640-4097-85ec-7801d833c2cb\" } We then used the this.helpers.returnJsonArray() method to map the API\u2019s output data to n8n's data structure. The node then ends up returning the data like the following: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 [ { json : { job_id : \"b82aca74-3640-4097-85ec-7801d833c2cb\" } } ]","title":"Processing multiples items"},{"location":"integrations/creating-nodes/code/create-first-node/#summary","text":"In this tutorial, we implemented the \"Create a Contact\" functionality of the FriendGrid API.

We also added the credentials so that the API Key could be stored safely. Finally, we mapped all the parameters to the FriendGrid API. This is just the tip of the iceberg. We built a regular node that consumes a REST API, but a regular node can do everything that can be done with Node.js.

The n8n-nodes-module is an npm package that contains the node. Your custom node will get loaded automatically when n8n starts. Consider creating n8n-nodes-module if any of the following conditions satisfy your needs: - The nodes are only for yourself, your organization, or a small group of people. - The nodes require external dependencies that are not already available in n8n. NOTE: n8n-nodes-module can only be installed in self-hosted n8n instances. This functionality is currently not available on n8n.cloud or the desktop app. There are plans to introduce this functionality in the future. Prerequisites # You may already be familiar with creating nodes in n8n. If you are unfamiliar with how to create n8n nodes, you can learn about it following the instructions mentioned in the Creating Your First Node tutorial. Install the following tools: Git: You can find instructions on how to install Git here . Node.js and npm: You can find instructions how to install both using nvm (Node Version Manager) here . The current minimum version is 14.15 . In case you already have Node.js and npm installed, you can check the current version with the following command: 1 2 node -v npm -v NOTE: Use node version 14.x and npm version 6.x . If using npm version 7+ , you must enable legacy peer dependencies by setting: npm config set legacy-peer-deps true . Lerna: You can install lerna globally with the following command: 1 npm i Install n8n: Create a new folder and install n8n using the command: 1 npm install n8n Create custom n8n-nodes-module # You can create multiple n8n-nodes-modules. Each individual n8n-nodes-module should get created in a separate folder since they are different npm packages. A single n8n-nodes-module can contain multiple nodes. If you\u2019re creating multiple nodes in the same module, as a best practice create each node in a separate folder. In this tutorial, you will create an n8n-nodes-module for the OpenWeatherMap API. You will name it n8n-nodes-weather . To quickly get started, clone the example starter using the following command: 1 git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter.git n8n-nodes-weather. After the repo gets cloned, open the package.json file, and update the value of the name by replacing n8n-nodes-starter with n8n-nodes-weather . NOTE: The name of the module has to start with n8n-nodes- . Open the cloned repository in your code editor, and create a new folder called Weather , inside the nodes folder. Create Weather.node.ts file inside the Weather folder and paste the following code: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 import { IExecuteFunctions , } from 'n8n-core' ; import { IDataObject , INodeExecutionData , INodeType , INodeTypeDescription , NodeApiError , NodeOperationError , } from 'n8n-workflow' ; import { OptionsWithUri } from 'request' ; export class Weather implements INodeType { description : INodeTypeDescription = { displayName : 'Weather' , name : 'Weather' , icon : 'fa:sun' , group : [ 'input' ], version : 1 , description : 'Gets current and future weather information' , defaults : { name : 'Weather' , color : '#554455' , }, inputs : [ 'main' ], outputs : [ 'main' ], credentials : [ { name : 'weatherApi' , required : true , }, ], properties : [ { displayName : 'Operation' , name : 'operation' , type : 'options' , options : [ { name : 'Current Weather' , value : 'currentWeather' , description : 'Returns the current weather data' , }, { name : '5 day Forecast' , value : '5DayForecast' , description : 'Returns the weather data for the next 5 days' , }, ], default : 'currentWeather' , description : 'The operation to perform.' , }, { displayName : 'Format' , name : 'format' , type : 'options' , options : [ { name : 'Imperial' , value : 'imperial' , description : 'Fahrenheit | miles/hour' , }, { name : 'Metric' , value : 'metric' , description : 'Celsius | meter/sec' , }, { name : 'Scientific' , value : 'standard' , description : 'Kelvin | meter/sec' , }, ], default : 'metric' , description : 'The format in which format the data should be returned.' , }, // ---------------------------------- // Location Information // ---------------------------------- { displayName : 'Location Selection' , name : 'locationSelection' , type : 'options' , options : [ { name : 'City Name' , value : 'cityName' , }, { name : 'City ID' , value : 'cityId' , }, { name : 'Coordinates' , value : 'coordinates' , }, { name : 'Zip Code' , value : 'zipCode' , }, ], default : 'cityName' , description : 'How to define the location for which to return the weather.' , }, { displayName : 'City' , name : 'cityName' , type : 'string' , default : '' , placeholder : 'berlin,de' , required : true , displayOptions : { show : { locationSelection : [ 'cityName' , ], }, }, description : 'The name of the city to return the weather of.' , }, { displayName : 'City ID' , name : 'cityId' , type : 'number' , default : 160001123 , required : true , displayOptions : { show : { locationSelection : [ 'cityId' , ], }, }, description : 'The id of city to return the weather of.

Create WeatherApi.credentials.ts file in the Credentials folder and paste the following code: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 import { ICredentialType , INodeProperties , } from 'n8n-workflow' ; export class WeatherApi implements ICredentialType { name = 'weatherApi' ; displayName = 'Weather API' ; properties : INodeProperties [] = [ { displayName : 'Access Token' , name : 'accessToken' , type : 'string' , default : '' , }, ]; } Add the newly created node and the credential to the package.json file. Add \"dist/nodes/Weather/Weather.node.js\" to the nodes array in the n8n object ( n8n.nodes ). Similarly, add \"dist/credentials/WeatherApi.credentials.js\" to the credentials array in the n8n object ( n8n.credentials ). Develop and test the module # Once you\u2019ve created the n8n-nodes-module, you need to build the code and publish the package locally to test it. Run the following commands: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 # Install dependencies npm install # Build the code npm run build # \"Publish\" the package locally npm link NOTE: If you get permission errors, run the command as a root user with sudo , for example sudo npm link . In the terminal, open the folder where you installed n8n. Run the following command to install the locally published module. 1 2 # \"Install\" the above locally published module npm link n8n-nodes-weather Start n8n with the below command 1 ./node_modules/n8n/bin/n8n start You will now be able to test and use your newly created n8n-nodes-module. Publish the n8n-nodes-module # As mentioned, the n8n-nodes-module is an npm package. To make it available to others, you can publish it to the npm registry. Refer to the Publishing unscoped public packages guide to learn about publishing packages. Following the steps mentioned above, you can create multiple nodes within a single n8n-nodes-module. You can also create nodes that require dependencies that are not present in n8n. When creating an n8n-nodes-module make sure that you follow the following guidelines: The name of the module should start with n8n-nodes- . The package.json file has to contain a key n8n with the paths to nodes and credentials. The module has to be installed alongside n8n. Use the n8n-nodes-module in production # Once you test and publish your n8n-nodes-module you would want to use it in your production environment. If you\u2019re running n8n via Docker, you will have to create a Docker image with the node module installed in n8n. Follow the steps below to create your Docker image: Create a Dockerfile and paste the code from this Dockerfile . Add the following command in your Dockerfile before the font installation command. 1 RUN cd /usr/local/lib/node_modules/n8n && npm install n8n-nodes-weather Your Dockerfile should be as follow: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 FROM node:14.15-alpine # ARG N8N_VERSION RUN if [ -z \" $N8N_VERSION \" ] ; then echo \"The N8N_VERSION argument is missing!\" ; exit 1 ; fi # Update everything and install needed dependencies RUN apk add --update graphicsmagick tzdata git tini su-exec # # Set a custom user to not have n8n run as root USER root # Install n8n and the also temporary all the packages # it needs to build it correctly.

Create Weather.node.ts file inside the Weather folder and paste the following code: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 import { IExecuteFunctions , } from 'n8n-core' ; import { IDataObject , INodeExecutionData , INodeType , INodeTypeDescription , NodeApiError , NodeOperationError , } from 'n8n-workflow' ; import { OptionsWithUri } from 'request' ; export class Weather implements INodeType { description : INodeTypeDescription = { displayName : 'Weather' , name : 'Weather' , icon : 'fa:sun' , group : [ 'input' ], version : 1 , description : 'Gets current and future weather information' , defaults : { name : 'Weather' , color : '#554455' , }, inputs : [ 'main' ], outputs : [ 'main' ], credentials : [ { name : 'weatherApi' , required : true , }, ], properties : [ { displayName : 'Operation' , name : 'operation' , type : 'options' , options : [ { name : 'Current Weather' , value : 'currentWeather' , description : 'Returns the current weather data' , }, { name : '5 day Forecast' , value : '5DayForecast' , description : 'Returns the weather data for the next 5 days' , }, ], default : 'currentWeather' , description : 'The operation to perform.' , }, { displayName : 'Format' , name : 'format' , type : 'options' , options : [ { name : 'Imperial' , value : 'imperial' , description : 'Fahrenheit | miles/hour' , }, { name : 'Metric' , value : 'metric' , description : 'Celsius | meter/sec' , }, { name : 'Scientific' , value : 'standard' , description : 'Kelvin | meter/sec' , }, ], default : 'metric' , description : 'The format in which format the data should be returned.' , }, // ---------------------------------- // Location Information // ---------------------------------- { displayName : 'Location Selection' , name : 'locationSelection' , type : 'options' , options : [ { name : 'City Name' , value : 'cityName' , }, { name : 'City ID' , value : 'cityId' , }, { name : 'Coordinates' , value : 'coordinates' , }, { name : 'Zip Code' , value : 'zipCode' , }, ], default : 'cityName' , description : 'How to define the location for which to return the weather.' , }, { displayName : 'City' , name : 'cityName' , type : 'string' , default : '' , placeholder : 'berlin,de' , required : true , displayOptions : { show : { locationSelection : [ 'cityName' , ], }, }, description : 'The name of the city to return the weather of.' , }, { displayName : 'City ID' , name : 'cityId' , type : 'number' , default : 160001123 , required : true , displayOptions : { show : { locationSelection : [ 'cityId' , ], }, }, description : 'The id of city to return the weather of.

Prerequisites # You have knowledge of: JavaScript/TypeScript REST APIs Webhooks Expressions in n8n Install the following tools: Git: You can find instructions on how to install Git here . Node.js and npm: You can find instructions on how to install both using nvm (Node Version Manager) here . The current minimum version is 14.15 . In case you already have Node.js and npm installed, you can check the current version with the following command: 1 2 node -v npm -v NOTE: Use node version 14.x and npm version 6.x Lerna: Install lerna globally with the following command: 1 npm install --global lerna Selecting the node # The first thing that we have to do is pick the service we want to create the node for. We will use Autopilot as an example. Since n8n's repository already has a Autopilot Trigger node, we will name this node Autofriend Trigger to avoid conflicts. Cloning the repository # In GitHub, fork the n8n repository . Clone it by running the following command in your terminal (don't forget to replace <USERNAME> with your GitHub username): 1 git clone https://github.com/<USERNAME>/n8n.git && cd n8n n8n is built from four main packages: cli core editor-ui nodes-base All these packages are under the /packages folder in the main n8n folder. We will be working in the nodes-base folder as it contains everything related to nodes. Specifically, /packages/nodes-base/nodes , packages/nodes-base/credentials , and packages/nodes-base/package.json . The folder nodes , contains all the nodes in n8n. The folder credentials contains all the credentials that the different nodes use. Each node can define multiple credentials. For example, OAuth2 or API Key. Each credential requires different parameters that the user will have to input. The credentials data that the user provides is stored in an encrypted format in n8n's database. The file package.json contains all the npm packages that the nodes use. It also contains all the nodes and credentials that are loaded when n8n is started. Creating the node # Go to packages/nodes-base/nodes . Create a folder called Autofriend (the folder names are PascalCase). Within the Autofriend folder, create a file called AutofriendTrigger.node.ts (YourNodeNameTrigger.node.ts). Download and add the Autofriend icon to the folder. Name it autopilot.svg . The icon property has to be either a 60x60 pixels PNG or an SVG and must exist in the node\u2019s folder. An SVG is preferable. In case you have to use a PNG, make sure that it is compressed. A good tool for that is tinypng . A good place to find company icons is gilbarbara/logos . Paste the following code in the AutofriendTrigger.node.ts file. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 import { IHookFunctions , IWebhookFunctions , } from 'n8n-core' ; import { IDataObject , INodeType , INodeTypeDescription , IWebhookResponseData , } from 'n8n-workflow' ; /* import { autofriendApiRequest, } from './GenericFunctions'; import { snakeCase, } from 'change-case'; */ export class AutofriendTrigger implements INodeType { description : INodeTypeDescription = { displayName : 'Autofriend Trigger' , name : 'autofriendTrigger' , icon : 'file:autofriend.svg' , group : [ 'trigger' ], version : 1 , subtitle : '={{$parameter[\"event\"]}}' , description : 'Handle Autofriend events via webhooks' , defaults : { name : 'Autofriend Trigger' , color : '#6ad7b9' , }, inputs : [], outputs : [ 'main' ], credentials : [], webhooks : [ { name : 'default' , httpMethod : 'POST' , responseMode : 'onReceived' , path : 'webhook' , }, ], properties : [], }; async webhook ( this : IWebhookFunctions ) : Promise < IWebhookResponseData > { return { workflowData : [], }; } } Your directory structure should now look like the following. Adding the node to Editor UI # n8n uses the properties set in the property description to render the node in the Editor UI. These properties are displayName , name , color , icon , description , and subtitle . Check the following figure to see how the properties affect the looks of the node. Note: The property description conforms to INodeTypeDescription . Let's see how the node looks in the UI by following these steps: Go to /packages/nodes-base/package.json . Paste \"dist/nodes/Autofriend/AutofriendTrigger.node.js\", in the nodes array to register the node (in an alphabetical order). Go to the project's main folder (n8n) in the terminal and run the following commands (it can take a few minutes). The first command installs all dependencies of all the modules and links them together. The second command builds all the code. The third command starts n8n in development mode. 1 2 3 lerna bootstrap --hoist npm run build npm run dev Open your browser and go to localhost:8080 and you should be able to see the Editor UI. Open the Create Node menu, select the Trigger tab, type Autofriend , and click on it to add the node to the Editor UI. Notes On startup, n8n will load all the nodes and credentials (more about credentials later) that are registered in /packages/nodes-base/package.json . The property description.name uses camelCase. The property description.color is the company's branding color in hexadecimal. In case the website does not include this information, there are other websites that help you get a company\u2019s branding colors. For example, brandpalettes.com . Creating the UI for the node # Double-clicking on the Autofriend Trigger node will open the Node Editor View. It will be empty since we haven't added any UI components yet. Luckily, n8n provides predefined JSON-based UI components that we can use to ask the user for different types of data. Autopilots's docs mention that to create a hook, we need to provide the following pieces of information: event - Required target_url - Required In the event parameter, we provide the name of the event for which we want to be notified. For example, contact_added . As the name implies, by providing contact_added as the event, we will be notified every time a contact is added to Autofriend. In the target_url parameter, we provide the URL where Autofriend will notify us when the event defined in the event parameter takes place. We don't need to ask the user for this parameter as n8n provides us with a method to obtain it. Adding the fields # Let\u2019s make the Node Editor View ask for these parameters: 1. Add the following under description.properties in packages/nodes-base/nodes/Autofriend/AutofriendTrigger.node.ts. . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 { displayName : 'Event' , name : 'event' , type : 'options' , required : true , default : '' , options : [ { name : 'Contact Added' , value : 'contactAdded' , }, { name : 'Contact Added To List' , value : 'contactAddedToList' , }, { name : 'Contact Entered Segment' , value : 'contactEnteredSegment' , }, { name : 'Contact Left Segment' , value : 'contactLeftSegment' , }, { name : 'Contact Removed From List' , value : 'contactRemovedFromList' , }, { name : 'Contact Unsubscribed' , value : 'contactUnsubscribed' , }, { name : 'Contact Updated' , value : 'contactUpdated' , }, ], }, Stop the current n8n process by pressing ctrl + c in the terminal in which you are running n8n. Run again, by entering the following in the terminal. 1 npm run dev Go to localhost:8080 , refresh the page, and open the node again. The node should now look like in the following image. Creating the UI for credentials # Most REST APIs use some sort of authentication mechanism. Autofriend's REST API uses API Keys. The API Key informs them about who is making the request to their system and gives you access to all the functionality that the API provides. Given all the things it can do, this has to be treated as a sensitive piece of information and should be kept private. n8n gives you the ability to ask for sensitive information using credentials. In the credentials, you can use all the generally available UI elements. Additionally, the data that is stored using the credentials would be encrypted before being saved to the database. In order to do that, n8n uses an encryption key. With that in mind, let\u2019s create the UI to ask for the user\u2019s Autofriend API Key. The process of creating and registering credentials is similar to that of creating and registering the node: Go to packages/nodes-base/credentials . Within the credentials folder, create a file named AutofriendApi.credentials.ts . Paste the following code. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 import { ICredentialType , NodePropertyTypes , } from 'n8n-workflow' ; export class AutofriendApi implements ICredentialType { name = 'autofriendApi' ; displayName = 'Autofriend API' ; properties = [ { displayName : 'API Key' , name : 'apiKey' , type : 'string' as NodePropertyTypes , default : '' , }, ]; } Go to /packages/nodes-base/package.json . Paste \"dist/credentials/AutofriendApi.credentials.js\", in the credentials array to register the credentials (in an alphabetical order). Got to packages/nodes-base/nodes/Autofriend/AutofriendTrigger.node.ts . Associate the credentials with the node by adding the following to description.credentials . 1 2 3 4 5 6 credentials : [ { name : 'autofriendApi' , required : true , }, ], Stop the current n8n process by pressing ctrl + c in the terminal in which you are running n8n. Run again, by entering the following in the terminal. 1 npm run dev When you go to the Node Editor view, you should see the following. Understanding the life cycle for the webhook method # When a Trigger node is executed either in test or production mode, the following happens: n8n persists all the webhooks defined in description.webhooks # The persisted data will be used later to verify if the incoming requests to the n8n\u2019s webhook endpoint are valid. The property webhooks implements the interface IWebhookDescription . The interface has four properties. name: The property name where n8n will look for the life cycle methods. httpMethod: The HTTP method. responseMode: When the trigger will respond. When developing a trigger node, this property must be set to onReceived . path: The path added to the base URL. For example, for a Trigger node with the following webhooks property, n8n will create the following webhooks URLs. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 webhooks : [ { name : 'default' , httpMethod : 'POST' , responseMethod : 'onReceived' , path : 'webhook' , }, ] Test: POST {{WEBHOOK_TUNNEL_URL || localhost}}/webhook-test/{{uuid}}/{{path}} Production: POST {{WEBHOOK_TUNNEL_URL || localhost}}/webhook/{{uuid}}/{{path}} These URLs can be found in the node under the Webhook URLs label. These webhook URLs will be used as the notification URL (also known as the callback URL or target URL) when creating the webhook in the external system. Note: In test mode, the webhooks are persisted in memory. In production mode, they are persisted in the database. n8n executes the life cycle methods # The life cycle methods allow us to create, delete, and check if the webhook exists in the external system. Methods checkExist : This is the first method that gets called. It checks if the webhook with the current path is already registered in the external system or not. If the webhook is already registered, n8n persists the webhook ID. If the webhook is not registered with the external system, the create method gets executed. create : This method gets called if the checkExist method returns false (if the webhook with the current path does not exist in the external system). This method registers the webhook in the external system and stores the webhook ID in n8n. delete : This method gets called when the trigger is either stopped manually or when the workflow is deactivated. It uses the ID previously persisted by either the create or the checkExist method to delete the webhook from the external system. Wait for new events to trigger the workflow # Every time the external system notifies us about a change, by making an HTTP Request to the URL we previously registered in the create method, the execute method is called. Within this method, we have access to the request object and everything it contains. For example, body, headers, querystring, etc. The data the method returns is the data we want the rest of the workflow to have access to. Let\u2019s see how this would look for our current use-case: Go to packages/nodes-base/nodes/Autofriend , create a file named GenericFunctions.ts , and paste the following code. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 import { OptionsWithUri , } from 'request' ; import { IExecuteFunctions , ILoadOptionsFunctions , } from 'n8n-core' ; import { IDataObject , IHookFunctions , IWebhookFunctions , } from 'n8n-workflow' ; export async function autofriendApiRequest ( this : IExecuteFunctions | IWebhookFunctions | IHookFunctions | ILoadOptionsFunctions , method : string , resource : string , body : any = {}, query : IDataObject = {}, uri? : string , option : IDataObject = {}) : Promise < any > { // tslint:disable-line:no-any const credentials = await this . getCredentials ( 'autofriendApi' ) as IDataObject ; const apiKey = credentials . apiKey ; const endpoint = 'https://api2.autopilothq.com/v1' ; const options : OptionsWithUri = { headers : { 'Content-Type' : 'application/json' , autopilotapikey : apiKey , }, method , body , qs : query , uri : uri || ` ${ endpoint }${ resource } ` , json : true , }; if ( ! Object . keys ( body ). length ) { delete options . body ; } if ( ! Object . keys ( query ). length ) { delete options . qs ; } try { return await this . helpers . request !

Replace the webhook function with the following. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 async webhook ( this : IWebhookFunctions ) : Promise < IWebhookResponseData > { const req = this . getRequestObject (); return { workflowData : [ this . helpers . returnJsonArray ( req . body ), ], }; 4. In the same file, uncomment the code snippet on the top to import autoFriendApiRequest and snakeCase . 5. Stop the current n8n process by pressing ctrl + c in the terminal where you are running n8n. 6. Run the project using a tunnel by entering ./packages/cli/bin/n8n start --tunnel in the terminal. Access the n8n Editor UI at localhost:5678 . 7. Enter the API key in the credentials. Instructions to find the API Key can be found here . 8. Go to the workflow editor, save your workflow, and execute the node. Log into Autopilot and update a contact. Keep in mind that this should be done within two minutes after you executed the node. After that time frame, the webhook will be unregistered automatically and you will not be able to receive the event. If it takes you longer than that, please execute the node and update the contact again. The trigger node is now receiving events. Sometimes it might take a bit longer for the payload to arrive. You probably noticed that this time we did not run the project using npm run dev , but instead using ./packages/cli/bin/n8n start --tunnel . Since our server is running locally, we need a tool that lets us proxy all requests to our local machine so that n8n receives and handles the events from the external service (Autopilot). This gets achieved using a tunnel. The details on how a tunnel works are out of the scope of this tutorial. If you want to know about it, you can check this link . Keep in mind that the tunnel is meant for development purposes only and should not be used in production. Summary # In this tutorial, we implemented one functionality of the Autofriend webhook API. We made the node show up in the Editor UI and in the Create Node menu with Autofriend's branding. Then, we added the fields necessary to create a webhook in the external service. We also added the credentials so that the API Key could be stored safely. Finally, we mapped all the parameters to the Autofriend API.

The default method is GET . Some notes about the possible fields: body : You can use a regular Javascript Object for JSON payload, a Buffer for file uploads, an instance of FormData for multipart/form-data and URLSearchParams for application/x-www-form-urlencoded . headers : A simple key-value pair. If body is an instance of FormData then content-type: multipart/form-data is injected automatically. If body is an instance of URLSearchParams , then content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded is added. To override this behavior, you can set any content-type header you wish and it won't be overridden. arrayFormat : If your query string contains an array of data, let's say const qs = {IDs: [15,17]} , the values set to arrayFormat define how it will be sent. indices (default): { a: ['b', 'c'] } will be formatted as a[0]=b&a[1]=c brackets : { a: ['b', 'c'] } will be formatted as a[]=b&a[]=c repeat : { a: ['b', 'c'] } will be formatted as a=b&a=c comma : { a: ['b', 'c'] } will be formatted as a=b,c auth : Used for Basic auth. Provide username and password . disableFollowRedirect : By default, we'll follow redirects. You can set this to false to prevent this from happening skipSslCertificateValidation : Used for calling HTTPS services without proper certificate returnFullResponse : Instead of returning only the body, returns an object with more data in the following format: {body: body, headers: object, statusCode: 200, statusMessage: 'OK'} encoding : We usually detect the content type correctly but you can specify arrayBuffer to receive a Buffer you can read from and interact with. Deprecation of the previous helper # The previous helper implementation using this.helpers.request(options) used and exposed the request-promise library which was deprecated. In an effort to keep maximum compatibility, we made a transparent conversion to another library called axios . If you are having issues, please report them in our Community Forums or on Github . Also, you can temporarily enable n8n to use the deprecated library by setting the environment variable N8N_USE_DEPRECATED_REQUEST_LIB=true . Please note: This behavior is permanent and we will be removing the request-promise library entirely in the future so please report any errors you have so we can fix them. Migration guide to the new helper # As mentioned above, the previous helper is deprecated and will be replaced in the future. The new helper is much more robust, library agnostic, and easier to use. New nodes should all use the new helper, and if you have built custom nodes we strongly suggest you migrate to the new helper. Here are the main considerations when migrating: Only url is accepted.

The default method is GET . Some notes about the possible fields: body : You can use a regular Javascript Object for JSON payload, a Buffer for file uploads, an instance of FormData for multipart/form-data and URLSearchParams for application/x-www-form-urlencoded . headers : A simple key-value pair. If body is an instance of FormData then content-type: multipart/form-data is injected automatically. If body is an instance of URLSearchParams , then content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded is added. To override this behavior, you can set any content-type header you wish and it won't be overridden. arrayFormat : If your query string contains an array of data, let's say const qs = {IDs: [15,17]} , the values set to arrayFormat define how it will be sent. indices (default): { a: ['b', 'c'] } will be formatted as a[0]=b&a[1]=c brackets : { a: ['b', 'c'] } will be formatted as a[]=b&a[]=c repeat : { a: ['b', 'c'] } will be formatted as a=b&a=c comma : { a: ['b', 'c'] } will be formatted as a=b,c auth : Used for Basic auth. Provide username and password . disableFollowRedirect : By default, we'll follow redirects. You can set this to false to prevent this from happening skipSslCertificateValidation : Used for calling HTTPS services without proper certificate returnFullResponse : Instead of returning only the body, returns an object with more data in the following format: {body: body, headers: object, statusCode: 200, statusMessage: 'OK'} encoding : We usually detect the content type correctly but you can specify arrayBuffer to receive a Buffer you can read from and interact with.","title":"How to use"},{"location":"integrations/creating-nodes/code/http-helpers/#deprecation-of-the-previous-helper","text":"The previous helper implementation using this.helpers.request(options) used and exposed the request-promise library which was deprecated.

It is important to follow the following guidelines: Do not change incoming data # Never change the incoming data a node receives (which can be queried with this.getInputData() ) as it gets shared by all nodes. If data has to get added, changed or deleted it has to be cloned and the new data returned. If that is not done, sibling nodes which execute after the current one will operate on the altered data and would process different data than they were supposed to. It is however not needed to always clone all the data. If a node for, example only, changes only the binary data but not the JSON data, a new item can be created which reuses the reference to the JSON item. An example can be seen in the code of the ReadBinaryFile-Node . Write nodes in TypeScript # All code of n8n is written in TypeScript and hence, the nodes should also be written in TypeScript. That makes development easier, faster, and avoids at least some bugs. Use the built in request library # Some third-party services have their own libraries on npm which make it easier to create an integration. It can be quite tempting to use them. The problem with those is that you add another dependency and not only one, you add but also all the dependencies of the dependencies. This means more and more code gets added, has to get loaded, can introduce security vulnerabilities, bugs, and so on. So please use the built-in module which can be used like this: 1 const response = await this . helpers . httpRequest ( options ); The full documentation and migration instructions from the deprecated this.helpers.request can be found here . That is using the npm package request-promise-native which is the basic npm request module but with promises. For a full set of options consider looking at the underlying request options documentation . Reuse parameter names # When a node can perform multiple operations like edit and delete some kind of entity, for both operations, it would need an entity-id. Do not call them \"editId\" and \"deleteId\", call them \"id\". n8n can handle multiple parameters with the same name without a problem as long as only one is visible. To make sure that is the case, the \"displayOptions\" can be used. By keeping the same name, the value can be kept if a user switches the operation from \"edit\" to \"delete\". Create an 'Additional Fields' parameter # Some nodes may need a lot of options. Add only the very important ones to the top level and for all others, create an 'Additional Fields' parameter where they can be added if needed. This ensures that the interface stays clean and does not unnecessarily confuse people. A good example of that would be the XML node. Follow existing parameter naming guideline # There is not much of a guideline yet but if your node can do multiple things, call the parameter which sets the behavior either \"mode\" (like \"Merge\" and \"XML\" node) or \"operation\" like the most other ones. If these operations can be done on different resources (like \"User\" or \"Order) create a \"resource\" parameter (like \"Pipedrive\" and \"Trello\" node). Node icons # Check existing node icons as a reference when you create own ones. The resolution of an icon should be 60x60px and saved as PNG. Node versions # n8n now supports node versioning and it's a blast! You can make changes to existing nodes without breaking the existing behavior by introducing a new version. You can check an example of a versioned node by browsing the Mattermost node . Node versioning in a glimpse: The main node file should now extend NodeVersionedType instead of INodeType The main node file now only contains a base description containing the defaultVersion (usually the latest) and a list of versions We recommend you use v1 , v2 , etc. for version folder names A new code separation has been created and can be seen in the Mattermost node above. Highlights: actions folder with description and implementation of each possible action methods is an optional folder with the loading dynamic parameters' functions transport is a folder with all the communication implementation Note: For the actions folder we recommend using resources and operations names as subfolders hierarchically. For the implementation an description you can use separate files. Our recommendation is to use execute.ts and description.ts as file names. This make browsing through the code a lot easier. This can be simplified for nodes that have a less complicated structure.","title":"Standards"},{"location":"integrations/creating-nodes/code/standards/#general-guidelines","text":"Please make sure that everything works correctly and that no unnecessary code gets added.

So please use the built-in module which can be used like this: 1 const response = await this . helpers . httpRequest ( options ); The full documentation and migration instructions from the deprecated this.helpers.request can be found here . That is using the npm package request-promise-native which is the basic npm request module but with promises.

To make sure that is the case, the \"displayOptions\" can be used.

Node versioning in a glimpse: The main node file should now extend NodeVersionedType instead of INodeType The main node file now only contains a base description containing the defaultVersion (usually the latest) and a list of versions We recommend you use v1 , v2 , etc. for version folder names A new code separation has been created and can be seen in the Mattermost node above. Highlights: actions folder with description and implementation of each possible action methods is an optional folder with the loading dynamic parameters' functions transport is a folder with all the communication implementation Note: For the actions folder we recommend using resources and operations names as subfolders hierarchically. For the implementation an description you can use separate files. Our recommendation is to use execute.ts and description.ts as file names. This make browsing through the code a lot easier.

Create a Record ID column in Airtable To create a Record ID column in your table, refer to this article . You can then use this Record ID in your Airtable node. Use the List operation To get the Record ID of your record, you can use the List operation of the Airtable node. This operation will return the Record ID along with the fields. You can then use this Record ID in your Airtable node. How to filter records when using the List operation? # To filter records from your Airtable base, use the Filter By Formula option. For example, if you want to return all the users that belong to the organization n8n , follow the steps mentioned below: 1. Select 'List' from the Operation dropdown list. 2. Enter the base ID and the table name in the Base ID and Table field, respectively. 3. Click on Add Option and select 'Filter By Formula' from the dropdown list. 4. Enter the following formula in the Filter By Formula field: {Organization}='n8n' . Similarly, if you want to return all the users that do not belong to the organization n8n , use the following formula: NOT({Organization}='n8n') .

Find out more about expressions by reading Expression . Fair-code # A software model very similar to open source which allows developers to receive remuneration for use in a for profit product. n8n is licensed under the fair-code model. See faircode.io for more details. Function # In programming, a set of reusable commands designed to be run together and launched by other commands in the code. It may or may not receive input from the command that launches it. Many of the nodes in n8n behave like functions, receiving specific input to generate a specific output. To learn more about functions , see Computer Programming - Functions . IP Address # A string of numbers and letters which represents the location of an electronic device on a TCP/IP network. n8n will often refer to IP addresses when accessing information on a system other than itself. This is more common when the service is on the local network rather than on the internet. If you want to learn more about IP addresses , see What Is an IP Address? . JavaScript # A modern programming language popular with web platforms used to create interactive web interfaces. While n8n is written in TypeScript, the final code generated is JavaScript and the Function node uses JavaScript to create customized nodes . JavaScript is used in the n8n's Function nodes. To learn more about Javascript, visit Javascript Tutorial . JSON # An open standard file and data format commonly used with JavaScript . It is easy for humans to read and for computers to parse. The majority of data that is transferred from one node to another in n8n is most likely in the JSON format. For further reading, please see Introducing JSON . Header # Section of an HTTP request message that defines allows extra information to be passed between the transmitter and receiver. n8n has the ability to send custom header information to many APIs , specifically in the HTTP Request node .

For more information, see software package . See also: - npx Parameter # Data that is passed to a program or script which is used for processing and directly effects the output or results generated. Many n8n nodes accept parameters to customize their output. The n8n CLI also accepts parameters so that it knows how to properly execute. For more information, see Functions, procedures nad modules . Password # A secret string of characters provided to prove one's identity. Often used to gain access to restricted applications and systems. The n8n Editor UI can be password protected so that only authorized users can access the interface. n8n also stores passwords as a part of credentials for some services. To read more about passwords , see The Importance of passwords . See also: - Username - Token REST API # See API Root User # In *NIX operating system, the user account that has no restrictions placed upon it within the system. The root user is typically only used for performing maintenance and upgrade tasks as improperly run applications using the root user account can cause significant damage to the system. For the protection of the system, it is generally not recommended that n8n be run by the root user. For more information about root , see root Definition . SSL # An acronym for Secure Socket Layer , it is the primary way that web based services are secured. A SSL certificate is often used on websites to encrypt the information that is travelling between a web server and a web page. n8n uses SSL certificates to secure the n8n UI so that any information that is passed between the n8n server and the user's web browser is encrypted and cannot be spied upon when it is travelling between the two. It is possible to customize the SSL installation. For further reading, see SSL and SSL Certificates Explained For Beginners . Token # A unique identifier, typically a long string of characters, used to increase the security of systems that request or transmit data. It is usually a shared secret between the sender and the receiver to allow either system to determine if they should be requesting/transmitting data. Tokens can also sometimes be used as encryption keys to make the data which is transmitted illegible to thoses without the token. n8n uses tokens often when requesting or sending data using APIs or webhooks . For more information, see token . Trigger # A specific type of node that starts a workflow when it receives data from a source outside of the workflow itself. A good example of a trigger node in n8n is a webhook . It listens for data coming into it and then starts a workflow when it sees data. For more information about triggers , see Event Driven Programming . Tunnel # An encrypted session between two systems used to secure data transmission. n8n uses a tunnel to allow external users to access n8n installations that are behind firewalls, typically for triggering webhooks . This setup is recommended for testing use only. For further reading, see VPN Tunnels explained: what are they and how can they keep your internet data secure . TypeScript # An open source programming language that extends the JavaScript programming language. n8n is written in TypeScript. Read more at Typescript .

What if I want to use n8n for something that is not permitted by the license? # You must sign a separate commercial agreement with us. We actively encourage software creators to embed n8n within their products; we just ask them to sign an agreement laying out the terms of use, and the fees owed to n8n for using the product in this way. We call this mode of use n8n.embed. You can learn more, and contact us about it here . If you are unsure whether the use case you have in mind constitutes an internal business purpose or not, take a look at the examples , and if you're still unclear, email us at license@n8n.io . Why do you not use an open source license? # n8n's mission is to give everyone who uses a computer technical superpowers. We've decided the best way for us to achieve this mission is to make n8n as widely and freely available as possible for users, while ensuring we can build a sustainable, viable business. By making our product free to use, easy to distribute, and source-available we help everyone access the product. By operating as a business, we can continue to release features, fix bugs and provide reliable software at scale long-term. Why did you create a license? # Creating a license was our least favorite option. We only went down this path after reviewing the possible existing licenses, and deciding nothing fit our specific needs. There are two ways in which we try to mitigate the pain and friction of using a proprietary license: (1) by using plain English, and keeping it as short as possible and (2) by promoting fair-code with the goal of making it a well-known umbrella term to describe software models like ours. Our goals when we created the Sustainable Use License were (1) to be as permissive as possible while (2) safeguarding our ability to build a business, and (3) being as clear as possible what use was permitted or not. My company has a policy against using code that restricts commercial use \u2013 can I still use n8n? # Provided you are using n8n for internal business purposes, and not making n8n available to your customers for them to connect their accounts and build workflows, you should be able to use n8n. If you are unsure whether the use case you have in mind constitutes an internal business purpose or not, take a look at the examples , and if you're still unclear, email us at license@n8n.io . What happens to the code I contribute to n8n in light of the Sustainable Use License? # Any code you contribute on GitHub is subject to GitHub's terms of use . In simple terms, this means you own, and are responsible for, anything you contribute, but that you grant other GitHub users certain rights to use this code. When you contribute code to a repository containing notice of a license, you license the code under the same terms. n8n asks every contributor to sign our Contributor License Agreement . In addition to the above, this gives n8n the ability to change its license without seeking additional permission. It also means you are not liable for your contributions (e.g. in case they cause damage to someone else's business). It's easy to get started contributing code to n8n here , and we've listed broader ways of participating in our community here . Why did you switch to the Sustainable Use License from your previous license arrangement (Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause)? # n8n was until 17 March 2022 licensed under Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause. Commons Clause was initiated by various software companies wanting to protect their rights against cloud providers. The concept involved adding a commercial restriction on top of an existing open source license. However, the use of the Commons Clause as an additional condition to an open source license, as well as the use of wording that is open to interpretation, created some confusion and uncertainty regarding the terms of use. The Commons Clause also restricted people's ability to offer consulting and support services: we realized these services are critical in enabling people to get value from n8n, so we wanted to remove this restriction. We created the Sustainable Use License to be more permissive and more clear about what use is allowed, while continuing to ensure n8n gets the funding needed to build and improve our product. What are the main differences between the Sustainable Use License and your previous license arrangement (Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause)? # There are two main differences between the Sustainable Use License and our previous license arrangement. The first is that we have tightened the definition of how you can use the software. Previously the Commons Clause restricted users ability to \"sell\" the software; we have redefined this to restrict use to internal business purposes. The second difference is that our previous license restricted people's ability to charge fees for consulting or support services related to the software: we have lifted that restriction altogether. That means you are now free to offer commercial consulting or support services (e.g. building n8n workflows) without the need for a separate license agreement with us. If you are interested in joining our community of n8n experts providing these services, you can learn more here. Is n8n open source? # Although n8n's source code is available under the Sustainable Use License, according to the Open Source Initiative (OSI), open source licenses cannot include limitations on use, so we do not call ourselves open source. In practice, n8n offers most users many of the same benefits as OSI-approved open source. We coined the term 'fair-code' as a way of describing our licensing model, and the model of other companies who are source-available, but restrict commercial use of their source code. What is fair-code, and how does the Sustainable Use License relate to it? # Fair-code is not a software license. It describes a software model where software: is generally free to use and can be distributed by anybody has its source code openly available can be extended by anybody in public and private communities is commercially restricted by its authors The Sustainable Use License is a fair-code license.

The data process performed by nodes can include filtering, recomposing, and changing data. There may be one or several nodes for your API, service, or app. By connecting multiple nodes, you can create simple and complex workflows. When you add a node to the Editor UI, the node is automatically activated and requires you to configure it (by adding credentials, selecting operations, writing expressions, etc.). There are three types of nodes: Core Nodes Regular Nodes Trigger Nodes Core nodes # Core nodes are functions or services that can be used to control how workflows are run or to provide generic API support. Use the Start node when you want to manually trigger the workflow with the Execute Workflow button at the bottom of the Editor UI. This way of starting the workflow is useful when creating and testing new workflows. If an application you need does not have a dedicated Node yet, you can access the data by using the HTTP Request node or the Webhook node . You can also read about creating nodes and make a node for your desired application. Regular nodes # Regular nodes perform an action, like fetching data or creating an entry in a calendar. Regular nodes are named for the application they represent and are listed under Regular Nodes in the Editor UI. Example # A Google Sheets node can be used to retrieve or write data to a Google Sheet. Trigger nodes # Trigger nodes start workflows and supply the initial data. Trigger nodes can be app or core nodes. Core Trigger nodes start the workflow at a specific time, at a time interval, or on a webhook call. For example, to get all users from a Postgres database every 10 minutes, use the Interval Trigger node with the Postgres node. App Trigger nodes start the workflow when an event happens in an app. App Trigger nodes are named like the application they represent followed by \"Trigger\" and are listed under Trigger Nodes in the Editor. For example, a Telegram trigger node can be used to trigger a workflow when a message is sent in a Telegram chat. Node settings # Nodes come with global operations and settings , as well as app-specific parameters that can be configured. Operations # The node operations are illustrated with icons that appear on top of the node when you hover on it: * Delete : Remove the selected node from the workflow * Pause : Deactivate the selected node * Copy : Duplicate the selected node * Play : Run the selected node To access the node parameters and settings, double-click on the node. Parameters # The node parameters allow you to define the operations the node should perform. Find the available parameters of each node in the node reference . Settings # The node settings allow you to configure the look and execution of the node. The following options are available: Notes : Optional note to save with the node Display note in flow : If active, the note above will be displayed in the workflow as a subtitle Always Output Data : If active, the node will return an empty item even if the node returns no data during an initial execution. Be careful setting this on IF nodes, as it could cause an infinite loop. Execute Once : If active, the node executes only once, with data from the first item it receives. Retry On Fail : If active, the node tries to execute a failed attempt multiple times until it succeeds Continue On Fail : If active, the workflow continues even if the execution of the node fails. When this happens, the node passes along input data from previous nodes, so the workflow should account for unexpected output data. If a node is not correctly configured or is missing some required information, a warning sign is displayed on the top right corner of the node.

Activating a workflow # Workflows that start with a Trigger node or a Webhook node need to be activated in order to be executed. This is done via the Active toggle in the Editor UI. Active workflows enable the Trigger and Webhook nodes to receive data whenever a condition is met (e.g., Monday at 10:00, an update in a Trello board) and in turn trigger the workflow execution. All the newly created workflows are deactivated by default. Sharing a workflow # Workflows are saved in JSON format. You can export your workflows as JSON files or import JSON files into your n8n library. Feel free to share your workflows on the n8n page and contribute to the workflow library. You can export a workflow as a JSON file in two ways: Download : Click the Download button under the Workflow menu in the sidebar. This will download the workflow as a JSON file.

Timezone : Sets the timezone to be used in the workflow. The default timezone is EDT (New York). The Timezone setting is particularly important for the Cron Trigger node. Save Data Error Execution : If the execution data of the workflow should be saved when the workflow fails. Save Data Success Execution : If the execution data of the workflow should be saved when the workflow succeeds. Save Manual Executions : If executions started from the Editor UI should be saved. Save Execution Progress : If the execution data of each node should be saved. If set to \"Yes\", the workflow resumes from where it stopped in case of an error. However, this might increase latency. Timeout Workflow : Toggle to enable setting a duration after which the current workflow execution should be cancelled. Timeout After : Only available when Timeout Workflow is enabled. Set the time in hours, minutes, and seconds after which the workflow should timeout. For n8n.cloud users a maximum available timeout is enforced for each plan (e.g. 3 minutes for Start level). Failed workflows # If your workflow execution fails, you can retry the execution. To retry a failed workflow: Open the Executions list from the sidebar. For the workflow execution you want to retry, click on the refresh icon under the Status column. Select either of the following options to retry the execution: Retry with currently saved workflow : Once you make changes to your workflow, you can select this option to execute the workflow with the previous execution data. Retry with original workflow : If you want to retry the execution without making changes to your workflow, you can select this option to retry the execution with the previous execution data. You can also use the Error Trigger node , which triggers a workflow when another workflow has an error. Once a workflow fails, this node gets details about the failed workflow and the errors.
